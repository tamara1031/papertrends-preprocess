Extending a result\nof Sauer, it is shown that coarse cohomological dimension is monotone under\ncoarse embeddings, and hence is invariant under coarse equivalence. We\ncharacterise unbounded quasi-trees as quasi-geodesic metric spaces of coarse\ncohomological dimension one.

One extension asymptotically connects\nwith centro-affine geometry on convex bodies as curvature approaches zero,\nwhile the other converges with Euclidean geometry.

The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at\nthe intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of\nthe representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the\nliterature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De\nSitter space to embed DAGs.

For the purpose of proving such a result we\nsettle several related questions pertaining both to the theory of intrinsic\nLipschitz graphs and to the one of currents. First, we prove an extension\nresult for intrinsic Lipschitz graphs as well as a uniform approximation\ntheorem by means of smooth graphs: these results stem both from a new\ndefinition (equivalent to the one introduced by F. Franchi, R. Serapioni and F.\nSerra Cassano) of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs and are valid for a more general\nclass of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs in Carnot groups. Second, our proof of\nRademacher's Theorem heavily uses the language of currents in Heisenberg\ngroups: one key result is, for us, a version of the celebrated Constancy\nTheorem. Inasmuch as Heisenberg currents are defined in terms of Rumin's\ncomplex of differential forms, we also provide a convenient basis of Rumin's\nspaces. Eventually, we provide some applications of Rademacher's Theorem\nincluding a Lusin-type result for intrinsic Lipschitz graphs, the equivalence\nbetween $\\mathbb H$-rectifiability and ``Lipschitz'' $\\mathbb\nH$-rectifiability, and an area formula for intrinsic Lipschitz graphs in\nHeisenberg groups.",
