          "abstract": "Results from the communication complexity literature have demonstrated that\nstable matching requires communication: one cannot find or verify a stable\nmatch without having access to essentially all of the ordinal preference\ninformation held privately by the agents in the market. Stated differently,\nthese results show that stable matching mechanisms are not robust to even a\nsmall number of labeled inaccuracies in the input preferences. In practice,\nthese results indicate that agents must go through the time-intensive process\nof accurately ranking each and every potential match candidate if they wish for\nthe resulting match to be guaranteedly stable. Thus, in large markets,\ncommunication requirements for stable matching may be impractically high.\n  A natural question to ask, given this result, is whether some higher-order\nstructure in the market can indicate which large markets have steeper\ncommunication requirements. In this paper, we perform such an analysis in a\nregime where agents have a utility-based notion of preference. We consider a\ndynamic model where agents only have access to an approximation of their\nutility that satisfies a universal multiplicative error bound. We apply\nguarantees from the theoretical computer science literature on low-distortion\nembeddings of finite metric spaces to understand the communication requirements\nof stable matching in large markets in terms of their structural properties.\nOur results show that for a broad family of markets, the error bound may not\ngrow faster than $n^2\\log(n)$ while maintaining a deterministic guarantee on\nthe behavior of stable matching mechanisms in the limit. We also show that a\nstronger probabilistic guarantee may be made so long as the bound grows at most\nlogarithmically in the underlying topological complexity of the market.",

There are inherent trade-offs\nbetween competing notions of efficiency, fairness and incentives in assignment\nmechanisms. It is, therefore, natural to consider mechanisms that satisfy two\nof these three properties in their strongest notions, while trying to improve\non the third dimension. In this paper, we are motivated by the following\nquestion: Is there a strategy-proof and envy-free random assignment mechanism\nmore efficient than equal division?\n  Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we further explore the\nincompatibility between efficiency and envy-freeness in the class of\nstrategy-proof mechanisms. We define a new notion of efficiency that is weaker\nthan ex-post efficiency and prove that any strategy-proof and envy-free\nmechanism must sacrifice efficiency even in this very weak sense. Next, we\nintroduce a new family of mechanisms called Pairwise Exchange mechanisms and\nmake the surprising observation that strategy-proofness is equivalent to\nenvy-freeness within this class. We characterize the set of all neutral and\nstrategy-proof (and hence, also envy-free) mechanisms in this family and show\nthat they admit a very simple linear representation.",

We study three solution concepts, the strong and weak stability\nconcepts proposed by Kamada and Kojima, and a new one in between the two,\ncalled cutoff stability. Kamada and Kojima showed that a strongly stable\nmatching may not exist in their most restricted model with disjoint regional\nquotas. Our first result is that checking its existence is NP-hard. We then\nshow that a cutoff stable matching exists not just for the summer internship\nproblem but also for the general matching model with arbitrary heredity\nconstraints. We present an algorithm to compute a cutoff stable matching and\nshow that it runs in polynomial time in our special case of summer internship\nmodel. However, we also show that finding a maximum size cutoff stable matching\nis NP-hard, but we provide a Mixed Integer Linear Program formulation for this\noptimisation problem.",

          "abstract": "A persuasion policy successfully persuades an agent to pick a particular\naction only if the information is designed in a manner that convinces the agent\nthat it is in their best interest to pick that action. Thus, it is natural to\nask, what makes the agent trust the persuader's suggestion? We study a Bayesian\npersuasion interaction between a sender and a receiver where the sender has\naccess to private information and the receiver attempts to recover this\ninformation from messages sent by the sender. The sender crafts these messages\nin an attempt to maximize its utility which depends on the source symbol and\nthe symbol recovered by the receiver. Our goal is to characterize the\n\\textit{Stackelberg game value}, and the amount of true information revealed by\nthe sender during persuasion. We find that the SGV is given by the optimal\nvalue of a \\textit{linear program} on probability distributions constrained by\ncertain \\textit{trust constraints}. These constraints encode that any signal in\na persuasion strategy must contain more truth than untruth and thus impose a\nfundamental bound on the extent of obfuscation a sender can perform. We define\n\\textit{informativeness} of the sender as the minimum expected number of\nsymbols truthfully revealed by the sender in any accumulation point of a\nsequence of $\\varepsilon$-equilibrium persuasion strategies, and show that it\nis given by another linear program. Informativeness is a fundamental bound on\nthe amount of information the sender must reveal to persuade a receiver. Closed\nform expressions for the SGV and the informativeness are presented for\nstructured utility functions. This work generalizes our previous work where the\nsender and the receiver were constrained to play only deterministic strategies\nand a similar notion of informativeness was characterized.

Buyer valuations are drawn\ni.i.d. from a distribution unknown to the seller; the seller only knows that\nthe support is included in $[a, b]$. To be robust, the seller chooses a DSIC\nmechanism that optimizes the worst-case performance relative to the ideal\nexpected revenue the seller could have collected with knowledge of buyers'\nvaluations. Our analysis unifies the regret and the ratio objectives.\n  For these objectives, we derive an optimal mechanism and the corresponding\nperformance in quasi-closed form, as a function of the support information $[a,\nb]$ and the number of buyers $n$. Our analysis reveals three regimes of support\ninformation and a new class of robust mechanisms. i.) When $a/b$ is below a\nthreshold, the optimal mechanism is a second-price auction (SPA) with random\nreserve, a focal class in earlier literature. ii.) When $a/b$ is above another\nthreshold, SPAs are strictly suboptimal, and an optimal mechanism belongs to a\nclass of mechanisms we introduce, which we call pooling auctions (POOL);\nwhenever the highest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates\nto the highest bidder, but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly\nrandom buyer, i.e., pools low types. iii.) When $a/b$ is between two\nthresholds, a randomization between SPA and POOL is optimal.\n  We also characterize optimal mechanisms within nested central subclasses of\nmechanisms: standard mechanisms that only allocate to the highest bidder, SPA\nwith random reserve, and SPA with no reserve. We show strict separations in\nterms of performance across classes, implying that deviating from standard\nmechanisms is necessary for robustness.",

          "abstract": "We present a general framework for designing approximately revenue-optimal\nmechanisms for multi-item additive auctions, which applies to both truthful and\nnon-truthful auctions. Given a (not necessarily truthful) single-item auction\nformat $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, we run simultaneous item\nauctions augmented with a personalized entry fee for each bidder that must be\npaid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the\nprior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of\nrealized bids. We bound the revenue of the resulting two-part tariff mechanism\nusing a novel geometric technique that enables revenue guarantees for many\ncommon non-truthful auctions that previously had none. Our approach adapts and\nextends the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16] beyond truthful auctions.\n  Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as\nsimultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay\nauctions. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue\nguarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments,\naddressing an open question in the literature [RST17]. If all-pay auctions are\nused, we prove that the resulting mechanism is also credible in the sense that\nthe auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after\nobserving agent bids. This is the first static credible mechanism for\nmulti-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal\nrevenue. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful\n$O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning\nvia online learning techniques.",

In\nsecond-price auctions, the equilibrium strategy is robustly feasible.\nConversely, in first-price auctions, the buyers must continue to adapt their\nstrategies according to the environment of the auction.

Moreover, we investigate how the notion of the\nmultiplier can help us in macroeconomic analysis of capital and investment\ndynamics and in understanding some general principles of capital market\nequilibrium. Using the concept of this multiplier, we build a macroeconomic\nmodel of capital market dynamics which is consistent with the implications of\nclassical models and with the market equilibrium condition but gives additional\nquantitative and qualitative predictions regarding the dynamics of shares of\ninvestment into the production of consumer goods and the production of means of\nproduction. The investment volume is modeled as a function of the multiplier:\ninvestments adjust when the value of the multiplier fluctuates around its\nequilibrium value of one.

To achieve this goal, the paper first summarizes three attributes of\neconomic structures from the literature, namely, structurality, durationality,\nand transformality, and discuss their implications for methods of economic\nmodeling. Then, with the common knowledge assumption, the paper extends Xing's\n(2023a) optimal growth model that is based on production function switching and\nconsiders an extended Ramsey model with endogenous structural transformation in\nwhich the social planner chooses the optimal industrial structure, recource\nallocation with the chosen structure, and consumption to maximize the\nrepresentative household's total utility subject to the resource constraint.\nThe paper next establishes the mathematical underpinning of the static,\ndynamic, and switching equilibria. The Ramsey growth model and its equilibria\nare then extended to economies with complicated economic structures consisting\nof hierarchical production, technology adoption and innovation, infrastructure,\nand economic and political institutions.

          "abstract": "In approval-based committee (ABC) elections, the goal is to select a\nfixed-size subset of the candidates, a so-called committee, based on the\nvoters' approval ballots over the candidates. One of the most popular classes\nof ABC voting rules are ABC scoring rules, which have recently been\ncharacterized by Lackner and Skowron (2021). However, this characterization\nrelies on a model where the output is a ranking of committees instead of a set\nof winning committees and no full characterization of ABC scoring rules exists\nin the latter standard setting. We address this issue by characterizing two\nimportant subclasses of ABC scoring rules in the standard ABC election model,\nthereby both extending the result of Lackner and Skowron (2021) to the standard\nsetting and refining it to subclasses. In more detail, by relying on a\nconsistency axiom for variable electorates, we characterize (i) the prominent\nclass of Thiele rules and (ii) a new class of ABC voting rules called ballot\nsize weighted approval voting. Based on these theorems, we also infer\ncharacterizations of three well-known ABC voting rules, namely multi-winner\napproval voting, proportional approval voting, and satisfaction approval\nvoting.",

Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,\ne.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which\nvoting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of\nvoting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on\naxioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may\nintentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for\ntheir own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that\ntheir top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their\nsecond-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no\ncoalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said\nto satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak\nStrategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for\nstrategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain\nintuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting\nrules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In\nmy thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and\nmajority rule are surprisingly still the only voting rules satisfying Weak\nStrategy-Proofness.",

A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two\nvoters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either\nvoter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on\nthe election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's\npreference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.",

          "abstract": "The concept of Nash equilibrium in behavioral strategies (NashEBS) was\nformulated By Nash~\\cite{Nash (1951)} for an extensive-form game through global\nrationality of nonconvex payoff functions. Kuhn's payoff equivalence theorem\nresolves the nonconvexity issue, but it overlooks that one Nash equilibrium of\nthe associated normal-form game can correspond to infinitely many NashEBSs of\nan extensive-form game. To remedy this multiplicity, the traditional approach\nas documented in Myerson~\\cite{Myerson (1991)} involves a two-step process:\nidentifying a Nash equilibrium of the agent normal-form representation,\nfollowed by verifying whether the corresponding mixed strategy profile is a\nNash equilibrium of the associated normal-form game, which often scales\nexponentially with the size of the extensive-form game tree. In response to\nthese challenges, this paper develops a characterization of NashEBS through the\nincorporation of an extra behavioral strategy profile and beliefs, which meet\nlocal sequential rationality of linear payoff functions and self-independent\nconsistency. This characterization allows one to analytically determine all\nNashEBSs for small extensive-form games. Building upon this characterization,\nwe acquire a polynomial system serving as a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor determining whether a behavioral strategy profile is a NashEBS.

Existing systems sell space using first-price\nauctions; however, users find it difficult to estimate how much they need to\nbid in order to get their transactions accepted onto the chain. If they bid too\nlow, their transactions can have long confirmation times. If they bid too high,\nthey pay larger fees than necessary.\n  In light of these issues, new transaction fee mechanisms have been proposed,\nmost notably EIP-1559, aiming to provide better usability. EIP-1559 is a\nhistory-dependent mechanism that relies on block utilization to adjust a base\nfee. We propose an alternative design -- a {\\em dynamic posted-price mechanism}\n-- which uses not only block utilization but also observable bids from past\nblocks to compute a posted price for subsequent blocks. We show its potential\nto reduce price volatility by providing examples for which the prices of\nEIP-1559 are unstable while the prices of the proposed mechanism are stable.\nMore generally, whenever the demand for the blockchain stabilizes, we ask if\nour mechanism is able to converge to a stable state. Our main result provides\nsufficient conditions in a probabilistic setting for which the proposed\nmechanism is approximately welfare optimal and the prices are stable. Our main\ntechnical contribution towards establishing stability is an iterative algorithm\nthat, given oracle access to a Lipschitz continuous and strictly concave\nfunction $f$, converges to a fixed point of $f$.",
