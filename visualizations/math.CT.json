          "abstract": "Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules.\nThe term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced\nby computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by\nidentity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of\nits semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of\nencoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and\nproperties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt\nRichard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We\nprove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural\n2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the\nsemantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map\n2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified\nby Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we\nobtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises\nGarner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the\ninterpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is\nwell-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a\nsemantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not\nadmissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of\nHofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types\nbut does not believe intensional ones.",

This\nworks well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity\nproofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a\nlong-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\n\"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying\ndifficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type\ntheory in the absence of UIP.\n  In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families\n($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the\npreviously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity\nsubstitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The\ntype-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although\nit remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known\nunsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is\npresented in two-level type theory (2LTT).\n  Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, the paper explains the shortcomings of\n1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and\napproaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

This representation uses a\nsubclass of the spectral spaces that Stone used in his representation of\ndistributive lattices via compact open sets. It also takes advantage of\nTarski's observation that the regular open sets of any topological space form a\nBoolean algebra. We prove without choice principles that any Boolean algebra\narises from a special spectral space X via the compact regular open sets of X;\nthese sets may also be described as those that are both compact open in X and\nregular open in the upset topology of the specialization order of X, allowing\none to apply to an arbitrary Boolean algebra simple reasoning about regular\nopens of a separative poset. Our representation is therefore a mix of Stone and\nTarski, with the two connected by Vietoris: the relevant spectral spaces also\narise as the hyperspace of nonempty closed sets of a Stone space endowed with\nthe upper Vietoris topology. In addition to representation, we establish a\nchoice-free dual equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras with\nBoolean homomorphisms and a subcategory of the category of spectral spaces with\nspectral maps.

Under mild finiteness assumptions, these\nresults not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in\nour sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated\ncategory, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all\nbounded $t$-structures are equivalent. The strategy used in our treatment is\nintroducing a new concept of finitistic dimension for triangulated categories\nand lifting $t$-structures along completions of triangulated categories.",

We also discuss fusions of topological defects, which involve\ncondensations/gaugings of higher-categorical symmetries localized on the\nworldvolumes of topological defects. Recently some fusions of topological\ndefects were discussed in the literature where the dimension of topological\ndefects seems to jump under fusion. This is not possible in the standard\ndescription of higher-categories. We explain that the dimension-changing\nfusions are understood as higher-morphisms of the higher-category describing\nthe symmetry. We also discuss how a 0-form sub-symmetry of a higher-categorical\nsymmetry can be gauged and describe the higher-categorical symmetry of the\ntheory obtained after gauging. This provides a procedure for constructing\nnon-invertible higher-categorical symmetries starting from invertible\nhigher-form or higher-group symmetries and gauging a 0-form symmetry. We\nillustrate this procedure by constructing non-invertible 2-categorical\nsymmetries in 4d gauge theories and non-invertible 3-categorical symmetries in\n5d and 6d theories. We check some of the results obtained using our approach\nagainst the results obtained using a recently proposed approach based on 't\nHooft anomalies.",

The principle that enables this generalization is the\nidentification of symmetries with topological defects in the QFT. In these\nlectures, we provide an introduction to generalized symmetries, with a focus on\nnon-invertible symmetries. We begin with a brief overview of invertible\ngeneralized symmetries, including higher-form and higher-group symmetries, and\nthen move on to non-invertible symmetries. The main idea that underlies many\nconstructions of non-invertible symmetries is that of stacking a QFT with\ntopological QFTs (TQFTs) and then gauging a diagonal non-anomalous global\nsymmetry. The TQFTs become topological defects in the gauged theory called\n(twisted) theta defects and comprise a large class of non-invertible symmetries\nincluding condensation defects, self-duality defects, and non-invertible\nsymmetries of gauge theories with disconnected gauge groups. We will explain\nthe general principle and provide numerous concrete examples. Following this\nextensive characterization of symmetry generators, we then discuss their action\non higher-charges, i.e. extended physical operators. As we will explain, even\nfor invertible higher-form symmetries these are not only representations of the\n$p$-form symmetry group, but more generally what are called\nhigher-representations.

We argue that for a d-dimensional quantum field theory the\nfull set of dual symmetries one obtains is in fact much larger and is described\nby a (d-1)-category, which is formed out of lower-dimensional topological\nquantum field theories with the same 0-form symmetry. We study in detail a\n2-categorical piece of this (d-1)-category described by 2d topological quantum\nfield theories with 0-form symmetry. We further show that the objects of this\n2-category are the recently discussed 2d condensation defects constructed from\nhigher-gauging of Wilson lines. Similarly, dual symmetries obtained by gauging\nany higher-form or higher-group symmetry also form a (d-1)-category formed out\nof lower-dimensional topological quantum field theories with that higher-form\nor higher-group symmetry. A particularly interesting case is that of the\n2-category of dual symmetries associated to gauging of finite 2-group\nsymmetries, as it describes non-invertible symmetries arising from gauging\n0-form symmetries that act on (d-3)-form symmetries. Such non-invertible\nsymmetries were studied recently in the literature via other methods, and our\nresults not only agree with previous results, but our approach also provides a\nmuch simpler way of computing various properties of these non-invertible\nsymmetries.
