This is the first general result, assuming only topological\nfreeness, in this direction, and these lead to new results on uniform property\n$\\Gamma$ and $\\mathcal{Z}$-stability for their crossed product $C^*$-algebras.\nSome concrete examples of minimal topological free (but non-free) subshifts are\nprovided.",

          "abstract": "We present a simplified explanation of why free fractional convolution\ncorresponds to the differentiation of polynomials, by finding how the finite\nfree cumulants of a polynomial behave under differentiation. This approach\nallows us to understand the limiting behaviour of the coefficients\n$\\widetilde{\\mathsf{e}}_k(p_d)$ of $p_d$ when the degree $d$ tends to infinity\nand the empirical root distribution of $p_d$ has a limiting distribution $\\mu$\non $[0,\\infty)$. Specifically, we relate the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio\nof consecutive coefficients to Voiculescu's $S$-transform of $\\mu$. This\nprompts us to define a new notion of finite $S$-transform, which converges to\nVoiculescu's $S$-transform in the large $d$ limit. It also satisfies several\nanalogous properties to those of the $S$-transform in free probability,\nincluding multiplicativity and monotonicity. This new insight has several\napplications that strengthen the connection between free and finite free\nprobability. Most notably, we generalize the approximation of $\\boxtimes_d$ to\n$\\boxtimes$ and prove a finite approximation of the Tucci--Haagerup--M\\\"oller\nlimit theorem in free probability, conjectured by two of the authors. We also\nprovide finite analogues of the free multiplicative Poisson law, the free\nmax-convolution powers and some free stable laws.",
