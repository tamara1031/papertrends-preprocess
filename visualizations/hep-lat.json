          "abstract": "Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much\nattentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge\ntheories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories\nwith local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected\nHamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way\ntowards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate\nthis concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with\nspinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge\ntheory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a\nfluctuating dynamical $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can\nbe realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical\nand numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is\nconfinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge\ntheory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using\nthe concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy\nphysics.",

We consider\ngauge-symmetry breaking perturbations that are quadratic in the gauge field,\nsuch as a photon mass term, and determine their effect on the critical behavior\nof the gauge-invariant model, focusing mainly on the continuous transitions\nassociated with the charged fixed point of the AH field theory.

We also address the critical behavior of lattice AH\nmodels with broken gauge symmetry, showing an effective enlargement of the\nglobal symmetry, from U(N) to O(2N), which reflects a peculiar cyclic\nrenormalization-group flow in the space of the lattice AH parameters and of the\nphoton mass.",

In this work, for an Abelian\nlattice gauge theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions, we define an entangled\nresource state (generalized cluster state) that reflects the spacetime\nstructure of the gauge theory. We show that sequential single-qubit\nmeasurements with the bases adapted according to the former measurement\noutcomes induce a deterministic Hamiltonian quantum simulation of the gauge\ntheory on the boundary. Our construction includes the $(2+1)$-dimensional\nAbelian lattice gauge theory simulated on three-dimensional cluster state as an\nexample, and generalizes to the simulation of Wegner's lattice models\n$M_{(d,n)}$ that involve higher-form Abelian gauge fields. We demonstrate that\nthe generalized cluster state has a symmetry-protected topological order with\nrespect to generalized global symmetries that are related to the symmetries of\nthe simulated gauge theories on the boundary. Our procedure can be generalized\nto the simulation of Kitaev's Majorana chain on a fermionic resource state. We\nalso study the imaginary-time quantum simulation with two-qubit measurements\nand post-selections, and a classical-quantum correspondence, where the\nstatistical partition function of the model $M_{(d,n)}$ is written as the\noverlap between the product of two-qubit measurement bases and the wave\nfunction of the generalized cluster state.",

Lattice results are\ncomputed on a large set of 17 gauge ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ Wilson\nClover-improved sea quarks. These ensembles cover four values of the lattice\nspacing between $a=0.049\\mathrm{fm}$ and $a=0.086\\mathrm{fm}$, a pion mass\nrange of $130 - 350\\mathrm{MeV}$ and various physical volumes. A precise\ndetermination of the notorious quark-disconnected contributions facilitates an\nunprecedented momentum resolution for the form factor, particularly on large\nand fine ensembles in the vicinity of physical quark mass. A large range of\nsource-sink separations $1.0\\mathrm{fm} \\lesssim t_\\mathrm{sep} \\lesssim\n3.25\\mathrm{fm}$ is used to reliably extract the relevant ground state matrix\nelements at vanishing and non-vanishing momentum transfer. This allows us for\nthe first time to obtain the scalar radii from a $z$-expansion parametrization\nof the $Q^2$-dependence of the resulting form factors rather than a simple,\nlinear approximation at small momentum transfer. The physical extrapolation for\nthe radii is carried out using three-flavor NLO chiral perturbation theory to\nparametrize the quark mass dependence in terms of three low-energy constants,\nincluding the first lattice determination of $L_4^r$. Systematic uncertainties\non the final results related to the ground state extraction, form factor\nparametrization as well as the physical extrapolation are accounted for via\nmodel averages based on the Akaike Information Criterion.",

The chiral phase transition temperature is\ndetermined by extrapolating to vanishing pion mass using universal scaling\nanalysis. After thermodynamic, continuum and chiral extrapolations we find the\nchiral phase transition temperature $T_c^0=132^{+3}_{-6}$ MeV.

We use clover fermion\naction for the valence quarks and tune the quark mass to match the lightest\nlight and strange masses in the sea. The resulting lattice matrix elements are\nnonperturbatively renormalized in regularization-independent\nmomentum-subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme and extrapolated to the continuum. We use\ntwo approaches to extract the $x$-dependence of the meson distribution\namplitudes: 1) we fit the renormalized matrix elements in coordinate space to\nan assumed distribution form through a one-loop matching kernel; 2) we use a\nmachine-learning algorithm trained on pseudo lattice-QCD data to make\npredictions on the lattice data. We found the results are consistent between\nthese methods with the latter method giving a less smooth shape. Both\napproaches suggest that as the quark mass increases, the distribution amplitude\nbecomes narrower. Our pion distribution amplitude has broader distribution than\npredicted by light-front constituent-quark model, and the moments of our pion\ndistributions agree with previous lattice-QCD results using the operator\nproduction expansion.",

          "abstract": "Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the\ndescription of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current\nfocus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and\ntheoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable\nand essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the\nstructure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In\nthis paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of\nthe pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for\nunpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators\ncomputable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone\nparton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the\nquasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements,\nthey are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data\npreviously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers\nand nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold\nlarger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$\nGeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the\nresulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The\nmatched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a\nfitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this\nprocedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the\nframework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum\ntransfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and\n$E$ GPDs.",

In this work we study the application of the gradient flow\ntechnique to the construction of the extended glueball operators. We examine a\nsimple application of the gradient flow method, which has some problems in\nglueball mass calculations at large flow time because of its nature of\ndiffusion in space-time. To avoid this problem, the spatial links are evolved\nby the ``spatial gradient flow'', that is defined to restrict the diffusion to\nspatial directions only. We test the spatial gradient flow in calculations of\nglueball two-point functions and Wilson loops as a new smearing method, and\nthen discuss its efficiency in comparison with the original gradient flow\nmethod and the conventional method. Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility\nof our proposed method, we determine the masses of the three lowest-lying\nglueball states, corresponding to the $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$\nglueballs, in the continuum limit in the pure Yang-Mills theory.",
