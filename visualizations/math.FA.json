          "abstract": "A long standing problem in abstract harmonic analysis concerns the strong\nArens irregularity (sAir, for short) of the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of a locally\ncompact group $G.$ The groups for which $A(G)$ is known to be sAir are all\namenable. So far this class includes the abelian groups, the discrete amenable\ngroups, the second countable amenable groups $G$ such that $\\overline{[G, G]}$\nis not open in $G,$ the groups of the form $\\prod_{i=0}^\\infty G_i$ where each\n$G_i$, $i\\ge1$, is a non-trivial metrizable compact group and $G_0$ is an\namenable second countable locally compact group, the groups of the form\n$G_0\\times G$, where $G$ is a compact group whose local weight $w(G)$ has\nuncountable cofinality and $G_0$ is any locally compact amenable group with\n$w(G_0)\\le w(G)$, and the compact group $SU(2).$ We were primarily concerned\nwith the groups for which $A(G)$ is sAir. We introduce a new class of\n$\\ell^1$-bases in Banach algebras. These new $\\ell^1$-bases enable us, among\nother results, to unify most of the results related to Arens products proved in\nthe past seventy years since Arens defined his products. This includes the\nstrong Arens irregularity of algebras in harmonic analysis, and in particular\nalmost all the cases mentioned above for the Fourier algebras. In addition, we\nalso show that $A(G)$ is sAir for compact connected groups with an infinite\ndual rank. The $\\ell^1$-bases for the Fourier algebra are constructed with\ncoefficients of certain irreducible representations of the group. With this new\napproach using $\\ell^1$-bases, the rich algebraic structure of the algebras and\nsemigroups under study such as the second dual of Banach algebras with an Arens\nproduct or certain semigroup compactifications (the Stone-\\v Cech\ncompactification of an infinite discrete group, for instance) is also unveiled",

These group $C^*$-algebras lie between the\nuniversal and the reduced group $C^*$-algebra. By directly investigating these\n$L^p$-integrability properties, we first show that for every non-compact,\nclosed subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(T)$ of a\n(semi-)homogeneous tree $T$ that acts transitively on the boundary $\\partial T$\nand every $2 \\leq q < p \\leq \\infty$, the canonical quotient map\n$C^*_{L^{p+}}(G) \\twoheadrightarrow C^*_{L^{q+}}(G)$ is not injective. This\nreproves a result of Samei and Wiersma. We prove that under the additional\nassumptions that $G$ acts transitively on $T$ and that it has Tits'\nindependence property, the group $C^*$-algebras $C^*_{L^{p+}}(G)$ are the only\ngroup $C^*$-algebras coming from $G$-invariant ideals in the Fourier-Stieltjes\nalgebra $B(G)$. Additionally, we show that given a group $G$ as before, every\ngroup $C^*$-algebra $C^*_{\\mu}(G)$ that is distinguishable (as a group\n$C^*$-algebra) from the universal group $C^*$-algebra of $G$ and whose dual\nspace $C^*_\\mu(G)^*$ is a $G$-invariant ideal in $B(G)$ is abstractly\n${}^*$-isomorphic to the reduced group $C^*$-algebra of $G$.",

          "abstract": "We define reduced and essential Banach algebras associated to a twisted\n\\'{e}tale (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $(\\mathcal{G},\\mathcal{L})$ and\nextend some fundamental results from $C^*$-algebras to this context. We prove\nthat for topologically free groupoids the associated essential Banach algebras\nhave the ideal interesection property, and thus such an algebra is simple if\nand only if the groupoid is minimal. We give conditions under which reduced\nalgebras are essential (for example Hausdorffness of $\\mathcal{G}$ is\nsufficient). This in particular solves the simplicity problem posed recently by\nGardella-Lupini for $L^p$-operator algebras associated to $\\mathcal{G}$. In\naddition, using either the $n$-filling or locally contracting condition we give\npure infiniteness criteria for essential simple Banach algebras associated to\n$(\\mathcal{G},\\mathcal{L})$. This extends the corresponding $C^*$-algebraic\nresults that were previously known to hold in the untwisted Hausdorff case. The\nresults work nicely, and allow for characterisation of the generalized\nintersection property, in the realm of $L^P$-operator algebras where $P\n\\subseteq [1,\\infty]$ is a non-empty set of parameters.
