          "abstract": "Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in non-Hermitian lattice systems, associated\nwith a point gap on the complex energy plane, has attracted great theoretical\nand experimental interest. Much less is studied on the so-called second-order\nnon-Hermitian skin effect, where the bulk does not support a point gap but\nlocalization at the corner still occurs. This work discovers a class of hybrid\nskin-topological modes as the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect without\nasymmetric couplings. Specifically, by only adding gain/loss to two-dimensional\nChern insulators and so long as the gain/loss strength does not close the line\ngap, all the topological edge states are localized at one corner under the open\nboundary condition, with the bulk states extended. The resultant non-Hermitian\nChern bands can be still topologically characterized by Chern numbers, whereas\nthe hybrid skin-topological modes are understood via some auxiliary Hermitian\nsystems that belong to either intrinsic or extrinsic second-order topological\ninsulator phases. By proposing an innovative construction of auxiliary\nHamiltonian, our generic route to hybrid skin-topological modes is further\nsuccessfully extended to nonequilibrium topological systems with gain and loss,\nwhere the anomalous Floquet band topology is no longer captured by band Chern\nnumbers. The extension thus leads to the intriguing finding of nonequilibrium\nhybrid skin-topological modes. In addition to offering a straightforward route\nto experimental realization of hybrid topological-skin effects, this study also\nopens up a promising perspective for the understanding of corner localization\nby revealing the synergy of three important concepts, namely, non-Hermitian\ntopological insulator, second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, and second-order\ntopological insulator.",

          "abstract": "Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is a tunable material with remarkably\nflat energy bands near the Fermi level, leading to fascinating transport\nproperties and correlated states at low temperatures. However, grown pristine\nsamples of this material tend to break up into landscapes of twist-angle\ndomains, strongly influencing the physical properties of each individual\nsample.

In this work, we study\nnumerically the effects of twist-angle disorder on quantum electron transport\nin mesoscopic samples of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We find a\nsignificant property of twist-angle disorder that distinguishes it from\nonsite-energy disorder: it leads to an asymmetric broadening of the\nenergy-resolved conductance. The magnitude of the twist-angle variation has a\nstrong effect on conductance, while the number of twist-angle domains is of\nmuch lesser significance. We further establish a relationship between the\nasymmetric broadening and the asymmetric density of states of twisted bilayer\ngraphene at angles smaller than the first magic angle.

          "abstract": "At the nanoscale, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) and thermal\nconductivity are not intrinsic properties of interfaces or materials but depend\non the nearby environment. However, most studies focused on single interfaces\nor superlattices, and the thermal transport across heterostructures formed by\nmultiple different materials is still mysterious. In this study, we demonstrate\nhow much the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second\ninterface, as well as how much the thermal conductivity of a material is\naffected by the nearby materials. Using Si and Ge modeled by classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are demonstrated. (1)\nThe existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the\noriginal interface. For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC\ncan be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K. This is because the nearby interface\nserves as a filter of phonon modes, which selectively allows particular modes\nto pass through and affect the TBC of the original interfaces. This impact will\ndisappear at the diffusive limit when the distance between interfaces is much\nlonger than the phonon mean free path so that phonon modes recover equilibrium\nstatistics before arriving at the second interface. (2) The thermal\nconductivity of a material can be significantly changed by the existence of\nneighboring materials. For example, a standalone 30-nm-thick Si's thermal\nconductivity can be increased from 50 to 280 W/mK, a more than 4-fold increase,\nbeating the bulk thermal conductivity of Si, after being sandwiched between two\nGe slabs. This is because the Ge slabs on the two sides serve as filters that\nonly allow low-frequency phonons to transport heat in Si, which carry more heat\nthan optical phonons. This work opens a new area of successive interface\nthermal transport and is expected to be important for nanoscale thermal\ncharacterization and thermal management of semiconductor devices.",

In our approach, a\nnanosculpted tapered optical fiber is used to simultaneously generate strain\nand probe the near-field optical response of WSe$_2$ monolayers at 5 K. When\nthe monolayer is pushed by the fiber, its lowest energy photoluminescence (PL)\npeaks red shift by as much as 390 meV, (corresponding to 20% of the bandgap of\nan unstrained WSe$_2$ monolayer). The red-shifting peaks are polarized\nperpendicularly to the WSe$_2$ plane and have long rising times (10 ps) and\nlifetimes (52 ps), indicating that they originate from nominally spin-forbidden\ndark excitons.

These excitons can be fully localized within a single TMD layer, or\nthe electron- and the hole-component of the exciton can be charge-separated\nover multiple TMD layers. Such intra- or interlayer excitons have been\ncharacterized in detail using all-optical spectroscopies, and, more recently,\nphotoemission spectroscopy. In addition, there are so-called hybrid excitons\nwhose electron- and/or hole-component are delocalized over two or more TMD\nlayers, and therefore provide a promising pathway to mediate charge-transfer\nprocesses across the TMD interface. Hence, an in-situ characterization of their\nenergy landscape and dynamics is of vital interest. In this work, using\nfemtosecond momentum microscopy combined with many-particle modeling, we\nquantitatively compare the dynamics of momentum-indirect intralayer excitons in\nmonolayer WSe$_2$ with the dynamics of momentum-indirect hybrid excitons in\nheterobilayer WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$, and draw three key conclusions: First, we find\nthat the energy of hybrid excitons is reduced when compared to excitons with\npure intralayer character. Second, we show that the momentum-indirect\nintralayer and hybrid excitons are formed via exciton-phonon scattering from\noptically excited bright excitons. And third, we demonstrate that the\nefficiency for phonon absorption and emission processes in the mono- and the\nheterobilayer is strongly dependent on the energy alignment of the intralayer\nand hybrid excitons with respect to the optically excited bright exciton.\nOverall, our work provides microscopic insights into exciton dynamics in TMD\nmono- and bilayers.",

Here, we\ndemonstrate memristive nano-devices based on SrTiO3 that inherently emulate all\nthese synaptic functions. These memristors operate in a non-filamentary, low\nconductance regime, which enables stable and energy efficient operation. They\ncan act as multi-functional hardware synapses in a class of bio-inspired deep\nneural networks (DNN) that make use of both long- and short-term synaptic\ndynamics and are capable of meta-learning or \"learning-to-learn\". The resulting\nbio-inspired DNN is then trained to play the video game Atari Pong, a complex\nreinforcement learning task in a dynamic environment. Our analysis shows that\nthe energy consumption of the DNN with multi-functional memristive synapses\ndecreases by about two orders of magnitude as compared to a pure GPU\nimplementation. Based on this finding, we infer that memristive devices with a\nbetter emulation of the synaptic functionalities do not only broaden the\napplicability of neuromorphic computing, but could also improve the performance\nand energy costs of certain artificial intelligence applications.",

          "abstract": "The photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskite\nsemiconductors are controlled by excitons, so that investigation of their\nfundamental properties is of critical importance. The exciton Land\\'e or\ng-factor g_X is the key parameter, determining the exciton Zeeman spin\nsplitting in magnetic fields. The exciton, electron and hole carrier g-factors\nprovide information on the band structure, including its anisotropy, and the\nparameters contributing to the electron and hole effective masses. We measure\ng_X by reflectivity in magnetic fields up to 60 T for lead halide perovskite\ncrystals. The materials band gap energies at a liquid helium temperature vary\nwidely across the visible spectral range from 1.520 up to 3.213 eV in hybrid\norganic-inorganic and fully inorganic perovskites with different cations and\nhalogens: FA_{0.9}Cs_{0.1}PbI_{2.8}Br_{0.2], MAPbI_{3}, FAPbBr_{3}, CsPbBr_{3},\nand MAPb(Br_{0.05}Cl_{0.95})_{3}. We find the exciton g-factors to be nearly\nconstant, ranging from +2.3 to +2.7. Thus, the strong dependences of the\nelectron and hole g-factors on the band gap roughly compensate each other when\ncombining to the exciton g-factor. The same is true for the anisotropies of the\ncarrier g-factors, resulting in a nearly isotropic exciton g-factor. The\nexperimental data are compared favorably with model calculation results.",

          "year": "2023-06",
          "abstract": "Size- and shape- dependent unique properties of the metal halide perovskite\nnanocrystals make them promising building blocks for constructing various\nelectronic and optoelectronic devices. These unique properties together with\ntheir easy colloidal synthesis render them efficient nanoscale functional\ncomponents for multiple applications ranging from light emission devices to\nenergy conversion and storage devices. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) metal\nhalide perovskites in the form of nanosheets (NSs) or nanoplatelets (NPls) are\nbeing intensively studied due to their promising 2D geometry which is more\ncompatible with the conventional electronic and optoelectronic device\nstructures where film-like components are employed. In particular, 2D\nperovskites exhibit unique thickness-dependent properties due to the strong\nquantum confinement effect, while enabling the bandgap tuning in a wide\nspectral range. In this review the synthesis procedures of 2D perovskite\nnanostructures will be summarized, while the application-related properties\ntogether with the corresponding applications will be extensively discussed. In\naddition, perovskite nanocrystals/2D material heterostructures will be reviewed\nin detail. Finally, the wide application range of the 2D perovskite-based\nstructures developed to date, including pure perovskites and their\nheterostructures, will be presented while the improved synergetic properties of\nthe multifunctional materials will be discussed in a comprehensive way.",

          "year": "2021-08",
          "abstract": "Understanding exciton-exciton interaction in multiply-excited nanocrystals is\ncrucial to their utilization as functional materials. Yet, for lead halide\nperovskite nanocrystals, which are promising candidates for nanocrystal-based\ntechnologies, numerous contradicting values have been reported for the strength\nand sign of their exciton-exciton interaction. In this work we unambiguously\ndetermine the biexciton binding energy in single cesium lead halide perovskite\nnanocrystals at room temperature. This is enabled by the recently introduced\nSPAD array spectrometer, capable of temporally isolating biexciton-exciton\nemission cascades while retaining spectral resolution. We demonstrate that\nCsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals feature an attractive exciton-exciton interaction, with\na mean biexciton binding energy of 10 meV. For CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals we\nobserve a mean biexciton binding energy that is close to zero, and individual\nnanocrystals show either weakly attractive or weakly repulsive exciton-exciton\ninteraction. We further show that within ensembles of both materials,\nsingle-nanocrystal biexciton binding energies are correlated with the degree of\ncharge-carrier confinement.",
