Therefore, once the manifold is properly\naligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the\nmanifold and maximum likelihood can be used to optimize the network parameters.\nNaturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an\ninjective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that the density\naligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density\nvolume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However,\nunless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold\nis not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent\ndimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis, with\ndegenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a\nlocally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical\nintrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space\nrepresentation.

Second, many standard data analysis tools initially\ndeveloped for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised efficiently to\ndata on a symmetric Riemannian manifold.

Thirdly, we generalize the above results for the\nnonholonomic reducible RCH system with symmetry, and prove two types of\nHamilton-Jacobi theorems for the nonholonomic reduced distributional RCH\nsystem. Moreover, we consider the nonholonomic reducible RCH system with\nmomentum map, by combining with the regular point and regular orbit reduction\ntheory and the analysis of dynamics of RCH system, we give the geometric\nformulations of the nonholonomic regular point reduced and orbit reduced\ndistributional RCH systems, and prove two types of Hamilton-Jacobi theorems for\nthese reduced distributional RCH systems. These researches reveal the deeply\ninternal relationships of the nonholonomic constraints, the induced (resp.\nreduced) distributional two-forms, the dynamical vector fields and controls of\nthe nonholonomic RCH system and its (reduced) distributional RCH systems.",

          "abstract": "In order to describe the impact of different geometric structures and\nconstraints for the dynamics of a regular controlled Hamiltonian system, in\nthis paper, we first define a kind of controlled magnetic Hamiltonian (CMH)\nsystem, and give a good expression of the dynamical vector field of the CMH\nsystem, such that we can describe the magnetic vanishing condition and the\nCMH-equivalence, and derive precisely the geometric constraint conditions of\nthe magnetic symplectic form for the dynamical vector field of the CMH system,\nwhich are called the Type I and Type II of Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Secondly,\nwe prove that the CMH-equivalence for the CMH systems leaves the solutions of\ncorresponding to Hamilton-Jacobi equations invariant, if the associated\nmagnetic Hamiltonian systems are equivalent. Thirdly, we consider the CMH\nsystem with nonholonomic constraint, and derive a distributional CMH system,\nwhich is determined by a non-degenerate distributional two-form induced from\nthe magnetic symplectic form. Then we drive precisely two types of\nHamilton-Jacobi equation for the distributional CMH system. Moreover, we\ngeneralize the above results for the nonholonomic reducible CMH system with\nsymmetry, and prove two types of Hamilton-Jacobi theorems for the nonholonomic\nreduced distributional CMH system. These research works reveal the deeply\ninternal relationships of the magnetic symplectic forms, the nonholonomic\nconstraints, the dynamical vector fields and controls of the CMH systems.",
