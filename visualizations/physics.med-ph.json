          "abstract": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) in PET/CT is commonly operated with a single\nenergy, resulting in a limitation of lacking tissue composition information.\nDual-energy (DE) spectral CT enables material decomposition by using two\ndifferent x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved\nmultimodality imaging, but would either require hardware upgrade or increase\nradiation dose due to the added second x-ray CT scan. Recently proposed\nPET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy spectral imaging using a\nconventional PET/CT scanner without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. A\ngamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV can be generated from the existing\ntime-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity\n(MLAA) approach and is then combined with the low-energy x-ray CT image to form\ndual-energy spectral imaging. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel\nMLAA method was further proposed by incorporating x-ray CT as a priori\ninformation. The concept of this PET-enabled DECT has been validated using\nsimulation studies, but not yet with 3D real data. In this work, we developed a\ngeneral open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction from PET data and use\nthis implementation for the first real data validation with both a physical\nphantom study and a human subject study on a uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT\nsystem. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of this method for\nspectral imaging and material decomposition.",

Obtaining the intrinsic dose distributions in particle therapy\nis a challenging problem that needs to be addressed by imaging algorithms to\ntake advantage of secondary particle detectors. In this work, we investigate\nthe utility of deep learning methods for achieving direct mapping from detector\ndata to the intrinsic dose distribution.\n  $Approach$. We performed Monte Carlo simulations using GATE/Geant4 10.4\nsimulation toolkits to generate a dataset using human CT phantom irradiated\nwith high-energy protons and imaged with compact in-beam PET for realistic beam\ndelivery in a single-fraction ($\\sim$2Gy). We developed a neural network model\nbased on conditional generative adversarial networks to generate dose maps\nconditioned on coincidence distributions in the detector. The model performance\nis evaluated by the mean relative error, absolute dose fraction difference, and\nshift in Bragg peak position.\n  $Main$ $results$. The relative deviation in the dose and range of the\ndistributions predicted by the model from the true values for mono-energetic\nirradiation between 50 MeV and 122 MeV lie within 1% and 2%, respectively. This\nwas achieved using $\\mathrm{10^5}$ coincidences acquired five minutes after\nirradiation. The relative deviation in the dose and range for spread-out Bragg\npeak distributions were within 1% and 2.6% uncertainties, respectively.\n$Significance$. An important aspect of this study is the demonstration of a\nmethod for direct mapping from detector counts to dose domain using the low\ncount data of compact detectors suited for practical implementation in particle\ntherapy.

The recent PET-enabled DECT method\nallows DECT imaging on PET/CT without requiring a second X-ray CT scan. It\ncombines the already existing X-ray CT image with a 511 keV \\gamma-ray CT (gCT)\nimage reconstructed from time-of-flight PET emission data. A kernelized\nframework has been developed for reconstructing gCT image but this method has\nnot fully exploited the potential of prior knowledge. Use of deep neural\nnetworks may explore the power of deep learning in this application. However,\ncommon approaches require a large database for training, which is impractical\nfor a new imaging method like PET-enabled DECT. Here, we propose a\nsingle-subject method by using neural-network representation as a deep\ncoefficient prior to improving gCT image reconstruction without\npopulation-based pre-training. The resulting optimization problem becomes the\ntomographic estimation of nonlinear neural-network parameters from gCT\nprojection data. This complicated problem can be efficiently solved by\nutilizing the optimization transfer strategy with quadratic surrogates. Each\niteration of the proposed neural optimization transfer algorithm includes: PET\nactivity image update; gCT image update; and least-square neural-network\nlearning in the gCT image domain. This algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically\nincrease the data likelihood.

It employs additional spatiotemporal ($x$-$t$) and self-consistent\nfrequency-temporal ($k$-$t$) priors to guide the diffusion process.

For instance, Cine MRI is the benchmark\nmodality for assessing the cardiac function and anatomy. On the other hand,\nmulti-contrast (T1 and T2) mapping has the potential to assess pathologies and\nabnormalities in the myocardium and interstitium. However, voluntary\nbreath-holding and often arrhythmia, in combination with MRI's slow imaging\nspeed, can lead to motion artifacts, hindering real-time acquisition image\nquality.

Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced by the\nlevel and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the\nblood flow in the left ventricle of the heart through a computational model\nconstructed from patient-specific data. The blood flow in the ventricle is\nmodeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the mitral valve\nby a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A\nfinite element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation\nof the velocity and pressure of the blood flow is constructed. A triple\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then used to distinguish\nbetween rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear\nflow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally\ndifferent flow structures, each generating a distinct type of mechanical\nstimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare the results to simulations\nwhere a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a\nsignificant modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear\nin the simulation cases treated with clips increased more compared to the\nuntreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease in valve opening\narea of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain,\nbut a 150 % increase in shear.
