          "abstract": "In a simple extension of the standard model (SM), a pair of vector like\nlepton doublets ($L_1$ and $L_2$) and a $SU(2)_L$ scalar doublet ($\\eta$) have\nbeen introduced to help in accommodating the discrepancy in determination of\nthe anomalous magnetic moments of the light leptons, namely, $e$ and $\\mu$.\nMoreover, to make our scenario friendly to a Dirac like neutrino and also for a\nconsistent dark matter phenomenology, we specifically add a singlet scalar\n($S$) and a singlet fermion ($\\psi$) in the set-up. However, the singlet states\nalso induce a meaningful contribution in other charged lepton processes. A\ndiscrete symmetry $\\mathcal {Z}_2 \\times \\mathcal {Z}_2^\\prime$ has been\nimposed under which all the SM particles are even while the new particles may\nbe assumed to have odd charges. In a bottom-up approach, with a minimal\nparticle content, we systematically explore the available parameter space in\nterms of couplings and masses of the new particles. Here a number of\nobservables associated with the SM leptons have been considered, e.g., masses\nand mixings of neutrinos, $(g-2)$ anomalies of $e$, $\\mu$, charged lepton\nflavor violating (cLFV) observables and the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of a\nsinglet-doublet dark matter. Neutrinos, promoted as the Dirac type states,\nacquire mass at one loop level after the discrete $\\mathcal{Z}_2^\\prime$\nsymmetry gets softly broken, while the unbroken $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ keeps the dark\nmatter stable. The mixing between the singlet $\\psi$ and the doublet vector\nlepton can be constrained to satisfy the electroweak precision observables and\nthe spin independent (SI) direct detection (DD) cross section of the dark\nmatter. In this analysis, potentially important LHC bounds have also been\ndiscussed.",

The scotogenic model connects\ndark matter, baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino oscillation data. In\nour work, we obtain baryogenesis by the decay of TeV scale heavy neutral\nsinglet fermion ($N_{2}$). We primarily focus on the intermediate-mass region\nof dark matter within $M_W<M_{DM}\\le550$ GeV, where observed relic density is\nsuppressed due to co-annihilation processes. We consider thermal as well as the\nnon-thermal approach of dark matter production and explore the possibility of\nthe lightest stable candidate being a dark matter candidate. Within the inert\nHiggs doublet (IHD) desert, we explore a new allowed region of dark matter\nmasses for the non-thermal generation of dark matter with a mass splitting of\n10 GeV among the inert scalars. We also see the variation of relic abundance\nfor unequal mass splitting among the scalars. The KamLand-Zen bound on the\neffective mass of the active neutrinos is also verified in this study.",

          "abstract": "We analyze the vacuum stability in the inert Higgs doublet extension of the\nStandard Model (SM), augmented by right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to explain\nneutrino masses at tree level by the seesaw mechanism. We make a comparative\nstudy of the high- and low-scale seesaw scenarios and the effect of the Dirac\nneutrino Yukawa couplings on the stability of the Higgs potential. Bounds on\nthe scalar quartic couplings and Dirac Yukawa couplings are obtained from\nvacuum stability and perturbativity considerations.

Here we calculate the entropy of the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole and of the Kerr black hole, which have two\nhorizons. For the spherically symmetric Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole we used\nseveral different approaches. All of them give the same result for the entropy\nand for the corresponding temperature of the thermal Hawking radiation. The\nentropy is not determined by the area of the outer horizon, and it is not equal\nto the sum of the entropies of two horizons. It is determined by the\ncorrelations between the two horizons, due to which the total entropy of the\nblack hole and the temperature of Hawking radiation depend only on mass $M$ of\nthe black hole and do not depend on the black hole charge $Q$. For the Kerr and\nKerr-Newman black holes it is shown that their entropy has the similar\nproperty: it depends only on mass $M$ of the black hole and does not depend on\nthe angular momentum $J$ and charge $Q$.",

The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to\ngravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In\nparticular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark\nmatter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of\ncaptured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on\neither the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions,\nwe account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form\nfactors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects\npertinent to sub-GeV dark matter.

One\nproposed solution is to introduce a new component in the early universe, which\ninitially acts as \"early dark energy\" (EDE), thus decreasing the physical size\nof the sound horizon imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and\nincreasing the inferred $H_0$. Previous EDE analyses have shown this model can\nrelax the $H_0$ tension, but the CMB-preferred value of the density fluctuation\namplitude, $\\sigma_8$, increases in EDE as compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, increasing\ntension with large-scale structure (LSS) data. We show that the EDE model fit\nto CMB and SH0ES data yields scale-dependent changes in the matter power\nspectrum compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, including $10\\%$ more power at $k =\n1~h$/Mpc. Motivated by this observation, we reanalyze the EDE scenario,\nconsidering LSS data in detail. We also update previous analyses by including\n$Planck$ 2018 CMB likelihoods, and perform the first search for EDE in $Planck$\ndata alone, which yields no evidence for EDE. We consider several data set\ncombinations involving the primary CMB, CMB lensing, SNIa, BAO, RSD, weak\nlensing, galaxy clustering, and local distance-ladder data (SH0ES). While the\nEDE component is weakly detected (3$\\sigma$) when including the SH0ES data and\nexcluding most LSS data, this drops below 2$\\sigma$ when further LSS data are\nincluded. Further, this result is in tension with strong constraints imposed on\nEDE by CMB and LSS data without SH0ES, which show no evidence for this model.\nWe also show that physical priors on the fundamental scalar field parameters\nfurther weaken evidence for EDE. We conclude that the EDE scenario is, at best,\nno more likely to be concordant with all current cosmological data sets than\n$\\Lambda$CDM, and appears unlikely to resolve the $H_0$ tension.",

We determine\nthese directly using a functional approach to QCD by Dyson-Schwinger and\nBethe-Salpeter equations in the very same setup we used previously to determine\npseudo-scalar meson exchange ($\\pi$, $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$) as well as meson\n($\\pi$ and $K$) box contributions. Particular care is taken to preserve gauge\ninvariance and to comply with short distance constraints in both the form\nfactors and the HLbL tensor.

          "abstract": "In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic\nlight-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using\na recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector\ncontributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis\nfunctions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor\nmesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a\ncombined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints,\nsupplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified\nassumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily\npropagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of\nthe matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of\nhadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain\n$a_\\mu^\\text{HLbL}\\big|_\\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\\times 10^{-11}$, which in\ncombination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach\nleads to $a_\\mu^\\text{HLbL}\\big|_\\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\\times 10^{-11}$.",

Both\napproaches suggest that as the quark mass increases, the distribution amplitude\nbecomes narrower.
