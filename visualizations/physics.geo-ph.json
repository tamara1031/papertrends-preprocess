          "abstract": "We applied a hybrid-dimensional flow model to pressure transients recorded\nduring pumping experiments conducted at the Reiche Zeche underground research\nlaboratory to study the normal opening behavior of fractures due to fluid\ninjection. Two distinct types of pressure responses to flow-rate steps were\nidentified and numerically modelled using a radial-symmetric flow formulation\nfor a fracture that comprises a non-linear constitutive relation for the\ncontact mechanics governing reversible fracture surface interaction. These two\ngroups represent radial-symmetric and plane-axisymmetric flow regimes from a\nconventional pressure-diffusion perspective. A comprehensive parameter study\ninto the sensitivity of the applied hydro-mechanical model to changes in\ncharacteristic fracture parameters revealed an interrelation between fracture\nlength and normal fracture stiffness that yield a match between field\nobservations and numerical results. Fracture stiffness values increase with\ncorresponding fracture length. Decomposition of the acting normal stresses into\na stresses associated with the deformation state of the global fracture\ngeometry and the contact stresses indicates that geometrically induced stresses\ncontribute the more the lower the total effective normal stress and the shorter\nthe fracture. Separating the contributions of the local contact mechanics and\nthe overall fracture geometry to fracture normal stiffness indicates that the\nlatter, the geometrical stiffness, constitutes a lower bound for total\nstiffness; its relevance increases with decreasing fracture length, too. Our\nstudy demonstrates that non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling can lead to vastly\ndifferent hydraulic responses and thus provides an alternative to conventional\npressure-diffusion analysis that requires changes in flow regime to cover the\nfull range of observations.",

          "abstract": "Failure and fault slip in crystalline rocks is associated with dilation. When\npore fluids are present and drainage is insufficient, dilation leads to pore\npressure drops, which in turn lead to strengthening of the material. We\nconducted laboratory rock fracture experiments with direct in-situ fluid\npressure measurements which demonstrate that dynamic rupture propagation and\nfault slip can be stabilised (i.e., become quasi-static) by such a dilatancy\nstrengthening effect. We also observe that, for the same effective pressures\nbut lower pore fluid pressures, the stabilisation process may be arrested when\nthe pore fluid pressure approaches zero and vaporises, resulting in dynamic\nshear failure. In case of a stable rupture, we witness continued prolonged slip\nafter the main failure event that is the result of pore pressure recharge of\nthe fault zone. All our observations are quantitatively explained by a\nspring-slider model combining slip-weakening behaviour, slip-induced dilation,\nand pore fluid diffusion. Using our data in an inverse problem, we estimate the\nkey parameters controlling rupture stabilisation, fault dilation rate and fault\nzone storage. These estimates are used to make predictions for the pore\npressure drop associated with faulting, and where in the crust we may expect\ndilatancy stabilisation or vaporisation during earthquakes. For intact rock and\nwell consolidated faults, we expect strong dilatancy strengthening between 4\nand 6 km depth regardless of ambient pore pressure, and at greater depths when\nthe ambient pore pressure approaches lithostatic pressure. In the uppermost\npart of the crust ($<4$ km), we predict vaporisation of pore fluids that limits\ndilatancy strengthening. The depth estimates where dilatant stabilisation is\nmost likely coincide with geothermal energy reservoirs in crystalline rock and\nin regions where slow slip events are observed.",

In this study, we present H-MEC\n(Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a newly-developed two-phase flow\nnumerical code - which couples solid rock deformation and pervasive fluid flow\n- to simulate how crustal stress and fluid pressure evolve during the\nearthquake cycle on a fluid-bearing fault structure. This unified,\ncontinuum-based model, incorporates a staggered finite\ndifference-marker-in-cell (SFD-MIC) method and accounts for full inertial (wave\nmediated) effects and fluid flow in poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible\nmedium. Global Picard-iterations and an adaptive time stepping allows the\ncorrect resolution of both long- and short-time scales, ranging from years\nduring slow tectonic loading to milliseconds during the propagation of dynamic\nruptures. We present a comprehensive in-plane strike-slip setup in which we\ntest analytical poroelastic benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an\ninjection point along a finite fault width. We then investigate how pore-fluid\npressure evolution and solid-fluid compressibility control sequences of seismic\nand aseismic slip on geologic faults. While the onset of fluid-driven shear\ncracks is controlled by localized collapse of pores and dynamic\nself-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone, subsequent\ndynamic ruptures are driven by solitary pulse-like fluid pressure waves\npropagating at seismic speed. Furthermore, shear strength weakening associated\nwith rapid self-pressurization of pore-fluid can account for the slip-fracture\nenergy scaling observed for large earthquakes.",

Using high-precision\niron isotopic data of 23 iron meteorites from nine major chemical groups we\nshow that all iron meteorites show the same fundamental dichotomy between\nnon-carbonaceous (NC) and a carbonaceous (CC) meteorites previously observed\nfor other elements. The Fe isotopic anomalies are predominantly produced by\nvariation in 54Fe, where all CC iron meteorites are characterized by an excess\nin 54Fe relative to NC iron meteorites. This excess in 54Fe is accompanied by\nan excess in 58Ni observed in the same CC meteorite groups. Together, these\noverabundances of 54Fe and 58Ni are produced by nuclear statistical equilibrium\neither in type Ia supernovae or in the Si/S shell of core-collapse supernovae.\nThe new Fe isotopic data reveal that Earth's mantle plots on or close to\ncorrelations defined by Fe, Mo, and Ru isotopic anomalies in iron meteorites,\nindicating that throughout Earth's accretion, the isotopic composition of its\nbuilding blocks did not drastically change. While Earth's mantle has a similar\nFe isotopic composition to CI chondrites, the latter are clearly distinct from\nEarth's mantle for other elements (e.g., Cr and Ni) whose delivery to Earth\ncoincided with Fe.

We aim to\nquantify the influence of planetary bulk composition on the\ninterior--atmosphere evolution for Earth-sized terrestrial planets to aid in\nthe interpretation of future observations of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres.\nMethods: We used a geochemical model to determine the major-element composition\nof planetary interiors (MgO, FeO, and SiO2) following the crystallization of a\nmagma ocean after planet formation, predicting a compositional profile of the\ninterior as an initial condition for our long-term thermal evolution model. Our\n1D evolution model predicts the pressure-temperature structure of the interior,\nwhich we used to evaluate near-surface melt production and subsequent volatile\noutgassing. Volatiles are exchanged between the interior and atmosphere\naccording to mass conservation. Results: Based on stellar compositions reported\nin the Hypatia catalog, we predict that about half of rocky exoplanets have a\nmantle that convects as a single layer (whole-mantle convection), and the other\nhalf exhibit double-layered convection due to the presence of a mid-mantle\ncompositional boundary. Double-layered convection is more likely for planets\nwith high bulk planetary Fe-content and low Mg/Si-ratio. We find that planets\nwith low Mg/Si-ratio tend to cool slowly because their mantle viscosity is\nhigh. Accordingly, low-Mg/Si planets also tend to lose volatiles swiftly\nthrough extensive melting. Moreover, the dynamic regime of the lithosphere\n(plate tectonics vs.\\ stagnant lid) has a first-order influence on the thermal\nevolution and volatile cycling. These results suggest that the composition of\nterrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres can provide information on the dynamic\nregime of the lithosphere and the thermo-chemical evolution of the interior.",

Their chemical compositions were established by nebular\nfractionation, with negligible contributions from post-accretionary losses of\nmoderately volatile elements.

          "abstract": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic inversion\ntechnique popularly used in oil and gas exploration. Traditional FWI employs\nthe $l_2$ norm measurement to minimize the misfit between observed and\npredicted seismic data. However, when the background velocity is inaccurate or\nthe seismic data lacks low-frequency components, the conventional FWI suffers\nfrom cycle skipping, leading to inaccurate inversion results. This paper\nintroduces a multiscale structural similarity index measure (M-SSIM) objective\nfunction for FWI. We also incorporate anisotropic total p-variation\nregularization (ATpV) to further improve the accuracy of FWI. M-SSIM extracts\nmulti-scale structural features of seismic data in terms of both phase and\namplitude. These features can reduce the risk of cycle skipping and improve the\nstability of FWI. Additionally, ATpV applies structural constraints to the\nvelocity gradients, which helps suppress artifacts and preserve the sharp\nboundaries of geological formations. We propose to use the automatic\ndifferentiation (AD) to efficiently and stably optimize this novelly introduced\nFWI objective function.

          "abstract": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) is an advanced seismic inversion technique for\nquantitatively estimating subsurface properties. However, with FWI, it is hard\nto converge to a geologically-realistic subsurface model. Thus, we propose a\nDiffusionInv approach by integrating a pretrained diffusion model\nrepresentation of the velocity into FWI within a Bayesian framework. We first\ntrain the diffusion model on realistic and expected velocity model samples,\npreferably prepared based on our geological knowledge of the subsurface, to\nlearn their prior distribution. Once this pretraining is complete, we fine-tune\nthe neural network parameters of the diffusion model by using an L2 norm of\ndata misfit between simulated and observed seismic data as a loss function.\nThis process enables the model to elegantly learn the posterior distribution of\nvelocity models given seismic observations starting from the previously learned\nprior distribution. The approximate representation of the posterior probability\ndistribution provides valuable insights into the inversion uncertainty for\nphysics-constrained FWI given the seismic data and prior model information.\nCompared to regularized FWI methods, the diffusion model under a probabilistic\nframework allows for a more adaptable integration of prior information into\nFWI, thus mitigating the multi-solution issue and enhancing the reliability of\nthe inversion result. Compared to data-driven FWI methods, the integration of\nphysical constraints in DiffusionInv enhances its ability to generalize across\ndiverse seismic scenarios.

Towards achieving this goal, here we\nconstruct a series of dynamical and physical climate networks based on the\nglobal near surface air temperature field.

Such deep learning models if\ntrained on observations can mitigate certain biases in current state-of-the-art\nweather models, some of which stem from inaccurate representation of\nsubgrid-scale processes. However, these data-driven models, being\nover-parameterized, require a lot of training data which may not be available\nfrom reanalysis (observational data) products. Moreover, an accurate,\nnoise-free, initial condition to start forecasting with a data-driven weather\nmodel is not available in realistic scenarios. Finally, deterministic\ndata-driven forecasting models suffer from issues with long-term stability and\nunphysical climate drift, which makes these data-driven models unsuitable for\ncomputing climate statistics. Given these challenges, previous studies have\ntried to pre-train deep learning-based weather forecasting models on a large\namount of imperfect long-term climate model simulations and then re-train them\non available observational data. In this paper, we propose a convolutional\nvariational autoencoder-based stochastic data-driven model that is pre-trained\non an imperfect climate model simulation from a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic flow\nand re-trained, using transfer learning, on a small number of noisy\nobservations from a perfect simulation.

The COI\nlocation near the mean latitude of the ionospheric Sq current vortex focus\nallows studying its variability using the S-type regular variations of the\ngeomagnetic field measured near the ground. The S-type variations for the X and\nY components of the geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can also\nbe re-scaled and used to analyze field variations obtained at other European\ngeomagnetic observatories at close latitudes. The S-type variations for the Z\ncomponent of the geomagnetic field obtained at the COI observatory can be\ncompared to similar variations observed at more continental regions to study\nthe so-called coastal effect in the geomagnetic field variations. The dataset\ndescribed in this paper is analyzed in a companion paper Comparison of the\nsolar variations of the geomagnetic field at the Coimbra Magnetic Observatory\n(COI) obtained by different methods: effect of the solar and geomagnetic\nactivity by A. Morozova and R. Rebbah submitted to ASR.",
