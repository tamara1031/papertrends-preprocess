Then every ideal $I$ in the ring of\nintegers ${\\mathcal O}_K$ contains infinitely many primitive elements, i.e.\nelements of degree $d$. A bound on smallest height of such an element in $I$\nfollows from some recent developments in the direction of a 1998 conjecture of\nW. Ruppert. We prove a very explicit bound like this in the case of quadratic\nfields. Further, we consider primitive elements in an ideal outside of a finite\nunion of other ideals and prove a bound on the height of a smallest such\nelement. Our main tool is a result on points of small norm in a lattice outside\nof an algebraic hypersurface and a finite union of sublattices of finite index,\nwhich we prove by blending two previous Diophantine avoidance results. We also\nobtain an avoidance result like this for lattice points in the positive orthant\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and use it to obtain a small-height totally positive\nprimitive element in an ideal of a totally real number field outside of a\nfinite union of other ideals. Additionally, we use our avoidance method to\nprove a bound on the Mahler measure of a generating non-sparse polynomial for a\ngiven number field. Finally, we produce a bound on the height of a smallest\nprimitive generator for a principal ideal in a quadratic number field.",

When k is a number\nfield, the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of\nX to the order of vanishing of certain L-functions. We consider the same\nconjecture when k is a global function field, and give a criterion for the\nconjecture to hold for X, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an\napplication, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate\nconjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over\nfunction fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth\nprojective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely\ngenerated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch\nconjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of\nMoonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over\narbitrary fields.",
