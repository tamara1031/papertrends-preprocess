Positive results are established in\ndimension $n\\geq 3$ for conformal metrics under the assumption that the\ngeodesic flow on the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. The paper\ncombines wave trace formula techniques with the injectivity of the geodesic\nX-ray transform for functions on closed Anosov manifolds. It is shown that\nknowledge of the Steklov spectrum determines the jet at the boundary of the\nunderlying Riemannian metric within its conformal class. In this particular\ncontext, this parallels the well-known results of the Calder\\'on problem, where\nwe are given the entire Dirichlet-to-Neumann map instead. As a simple\ncorollary, assuming real-analyticity of the conformal factor, Steklov\nisospectral metrics must coincide. Using similar arguments, we are also able to\nprove under the same assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow on the\nboundary, that generically any smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the\nSteklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by\nthe spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with potential $q$.\nConsequently, in this case, two analytic Steklov isospectral potentials must be\nequal.",

The domains are\nobtained by removing small geodesic balls that are asymptotically densely\nuniformly distributed as their radius tends to zero. We use this relationship\nto construct manifolds that have large Steklov eigenvalues.\n  In dimension two, and with constant weight equal to 1, we prove that\nKokarev's upper bound of $8\\pi$ for the first nonzero normalised Steklov\neigenvalue on orientable surfaces of genus 0 is saturated. For other\ntopological types and eigenvalue indices, we also obtain lower bounds on the\nbest upper bound for the eigenvalue in terms of Laplace maximisers. For the\nfirst two eigenvalues, these lower bounds become equalities. A surprising\nconsequence is the existence of free boundary minimal surfaces immersed in the\nunit ball by first Steklov eigenfunctions and with area strictly larger than\n$2\\pi$. This was previously thought to be impossible. We provide numerical\nevidence that some of the already known examples of free boundary minimal\nsurfaces have these properties and also exhibit simulations of new free\nboundary minimal surfaces of genus 0 in the unit ball with even larger area.\nThe first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of all these examples is equal to 1, as a\nconsequence of their symmetries and topology, so that they verify a general\nconjecture by Fraser and Li.\n  In dimension three and larger, we prove that the isoperimetric inequality of\nColbois--El Soufi--Girouard is sharp and implies an upper bound for weighted\nLaplace eigenvalues.

          "abstract": "We introduce a natural notion of mean (or average) distance in the context of\ncompact metric graphs, and study its relation to geometric properties of the\ngraph. We show that it exhibits a striking number of parallels to the\nreciprocal of the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian with standard vertex\nconditions: it is maximised among all graphs of fixed length by the path graph\n(interval), or by the loop in the restricted class of doubly connected graphs,\nand it is minimised among all graphs of fixed length and number of edges by the\nequilateral flower graph. We also establish bounds for the correctly scaled\nproduct of the spectral gap and the square of the mean distance which depend\nonly on combinatorial, and not metric, features of the graph. This raises the\nopen question whether this product admits absolute upper and lower bounds valid\non all compact metric graphs.",

          "abstract": "It is widely known that the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian is stable\nunder small perturbations of a domain, while in the case of the Neumann or\nmixed boundary conditions the spectrum may abruptly change. In this work we\ndiscuss an example of such a domain perturbation. Let $\\Omega$ be a (not\n{necessarily} bounded) domain in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We perturb it to $\n\\Omega_\\varepsilon=\\Omega\\setminus \\cup_{k=1}^m S_{k,\\varepsilon},$ where\n$S_{k,\\varepsilon}$ are closed surfaces with small suitably scaled holes\n(``windows'') through which the bounded domains enclosed by these surfaces\n(``resonators'') are connected to the outer domain. When $\\varepsilon$ goes to\nzero, the resonators shrink to points. We prove that in the limit\n$\\varepsilon\\to 0$ the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\\Omega_\\varepsilon$ with\nthe Neumann boundary conditions on $S_{k,\\varepsilon}$ and the Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on the outer boundary converges to the union of the\nspectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\\Omega$ and the numbers $\\gamma_k$,\n$k=1,\\dots,m$, being equal $1/4$ times the limit of the ratio between the\ncapacity of the $k$th window and the volume of the $k$th resonator. We obtain\nan estimate on the rate of this convergence with respect to the Hausdorff-type\nmetrics. Also, an application of this result is presented: we construct an\nunbounded waveguide-like domain with inserted resonators such that the\neigenvalues of the Laplacian on this domain lying below the essential spectrum\nthreshold do coincide with prescribed numbers.",
