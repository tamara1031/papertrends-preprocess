As\nreferences form explicit foundations for researchers to conduct a study, we\ninvestigate the evolution in reference patterns based on 60.8 million papers\npublished from 1960 to 2015. The results demonstrate that recent papers contain\nmore references than older ones, especially the well-cited papers compared with\nother papers. Well-cited papers receive 10 or more citations within 5 years of\npublication. Their references cover a longer period from classic research to\nvery recent studies. Authors of well-cited papers are also farsighted to\ndiscover the reference papers with good potential to receive high citation\nnumbers in near future. We also discover that the number of accumulative\npublications has a negative impact on next-5-year citation count for most\nfields except Chemistry, Materials science, Environmental science, Biology, and\nEngineering. Our findings suggest that researchers are expected to devote more\neffort to producing impactful research. Based on all these findings, we\nstrongly advise against judging researchers simply based on the number of their\npublications. On the other hand, authors and reviewers should ensure that\npublished papers contain adequate contributions.

This paper presents\na comprehensive bibliometric analysis on ESA by employing different algorithms\nin Matlab and R. The focus of results is on quantitative indicators relating to\nnumber and type of publication outputs, collaboration links between\ninstitutions, authors and countries, and dynamic trends within the field. The\nfive and twelve most productive countries have 50% and 80% of ESA publications\nrespectively. The dominant institutions are even more concentrated within a\nsmall number of countries. A significant concentration of published papers\nwithin countries and institutions was also confirmed by analysing collaboration\nnetworks. These show dominant collaboration within the same university or at\nleast the same country. There is also is a strong link among the most\nsuccessful journals, authors and institutions. The Energy journal has had the\nmost publications in the field, and its editor-in-chief Lund H is the author\nwith most of the publications in the field, as well as the author with most of\nthe highly cited publications in the field. In terms of the dynamics within the\nfield in the past decade, recent years have seen a higher impact of topics\nrelated to flexibility and hybrid/integrated energy systems alongside a decline\nin individual technologies.

          "abstract": "Scientific progress is often driven by groundbreaking and disruptive\nresearch, yet traditional metrics for evaluating contributions to science often\nemphasize quantity over quality. In this study, we consider metrics that focus\non the quality of scientific performance of countries and propose a novel\nframework that facilitates a competitive ranking of these countries based on\ntheir performance, highlighting the impact of their contributions. Using a\nbipartite network and centrality measures computed through the GENEPY scheme,\nwe evaluate the complexity and diversity of scientific fields. The analysis\nincorporates two quality indicators of a research paper: the network-based\nnormalized citation score (NBNC) to identify high-impact articles and the\nDisruptive Index (CD) to classify research as consolidating or disruptive.\nThese metrics focus on the perspective of citing articles, providing a\nlocalized view of scientific influence. Our study draws on bibliometric data\nfrom OpenAlex, encompassing nearly 60 million articles in the domain of\nphysical sciences published between 1900 and 2023. This data spans 10 fields,\n89 subfields, and approximately 1,300 topics, offering a comprehensive view of\nscientific development over time. By focusing on quality indicators such as\nbreakthroughs and disruptive research, our framework underscores the importance\nof transformative contributions that challenge existing paradigms and drive\ninnovation. This approach not only highlights the leading contributors to\nglobal science but also reveals patterns in the evolution of scientific fields.\nBy prioritizing impactful research, our study offers insights into optimizing\nresources for advancing science.

Various\napproaches have been proposed to organize scholarly information, including\ndescribing scholarly knowledge semantically leveraging knowledge graphs.\nTransforming unstructured knowledge, presented within articles, to structured\nand semantically represented knowledge generally requires human intelligence\nand labor since natural language processing methods alone typically do not\nrender sufficient precision and recall for many applications. With the recent\ndevelopments of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly possible\nto provide truly intelligent user interfaces guiding humans in the\ntransformation process. We present an approach to integrate non-intrusive LLMs\nguidance into existing user interfaces.

To enhance the professionalism and accuracy of\nresponses, many studies employ external knowledge augmentation. However,\nexisting structures of external knowledge in scientific literature often focus\nsolely on either paper entities or domain concepts, neglecting the intrinsic\nconnections between papers through shared domain concepts. This results in less\ncomprehensive and specific answers when addressing questions that combine\npapers and concepts. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge graph\nframework that captures deep conceptual relations between academic papers,\nconstructing a relational network via intra-paper semantic elements and\ninter-paper citation relations. Using a few-shot knowledge graph construction\nmethod based on LLM, we develop NLP-AKG, an academic knowledge graph for the\nNLP domain, by extracting 620,353 entities and 2,271,584 relations from 60,826\npapers in ACL Anthology.

This research focuses on effectively conveying structured scholarly\nknowledge by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to categorize scholarly\narticles and describe their contributions in a structured and comparable\nmanner. While previous studies explored language models within specific\nresearch domains, the extensive domain-independent knowledge captured by LLMs\noffers a substantial opportunity for generating structured contribution\ndescriptions as CKGs. Additionally, LLMs offer customizable pathways through\nprompt engineering or fine-tuning, thus facilitating to leveraging of smaller\nLLMs known for their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental\nconsiderations. Our methodology involves harnessing LLM knowledge, and\ncomplementing it with domain expert-verified scholarly data sourced from a CKG.\nThis strategic fusion significantly enhances LLM performance, especially in\ntasks like scholarly article categorization and predicate recommendation. Our\nmethod involves fine-tuning LLMs with CKG knowledge and additionally injecting\nknowledge from a CKG with a novel prompting technique significantly increasing\nthe accuracy of scholarly knowledge extraction.

          "abstract": "Publishing research data aims to improve the transparency of research results\nand facilitate the reuse of datasets. In both cases, referencing the datasets\nthat were used is recommended. Research data repositories can support data\nreferencing through various measures and also benefit from it, for example\nusing this information to demonstrate their impact. However, the literature\nshows that the practice of formally citing research data is not widespread,\ndata metrics are not yet established, and effective incentive structures are\nlacking. This article examines how often and in what form datasets published\nvia the research data repository RADAR are referenced. For this purpose, the\ndata sources Google Scholar, DataCite Event Data and the Data Citation Corpus\nwere analyzed. The analysis shows that 27.9 % of the datasets in the repository\nwere referenced at least once. 21.4 % of these references were (also) present\nin the reference lists and are therefore considered data citations. Datasets\nwere referenced often in data availability statements. A comparison of the\nthree data sources showed that there was little overlap in the coverage of\nreferences. In most cases (75.8 %), data and referencing objects were published\nin the same year. Two definition approaches were considered to investigate data\nreuse. 118 RADAR datasets were referenced more than once.

Furthermore, a coding framework was developed to capture the key\nelements of data acquiring and data sharing. The articles representing life\nsciences and computational research relatively frequently reused open data,\nwhereas data acquisition of experimental research, human interaction studies\nand human intervention studies often relied on collecting original data. Data\nsharing also differed between the computationally intensive study types of life\nsciences and computational research and the study types relying on collection\nof original data.

          "abstract": "The ability to find data is central to the FAIR principles underlying\nresearch data stewardship. As with the ability to reuse data, efforts to ensure\nand enhance findability have historically focused on discoverability of data by\nother researchers, but there is a growing recognition of the importance of\nstewarding data in a fashion that makes them FAIR for a wide range of potential\nreusers and stakeholders. Research institutions are one such stakeholder and\nhave a range of motivations for discovering data, specifically those affiliated\nwith a focal institution, from facilitating compliance with funder provisions\nto gathering data to inform research data services. However, many research\ndatasets and repositories are not optimized for institutional discovery (e.g.,\nnot recording or standardizing affiliation metadata), which creates downstream\nobstacles to workflows designed for theoretically comprehensive discovery and\nto metadata-conscious data generators. Here I describe an open-source workflow\nfor institutional tracking of research datasets at the University of Texas at\nAustin. This workflow comprises a multi-faceted approach that utilizes multiple\nopen application programming interfaces (APIs) in order to address some of the\ncommon challenges to institutional discovery, such as variation in whether\naffiliation metadata are recorded or made public, and if so, how metadata are\nstandardized, structured, and recorded. It is presently able to retrieve more\nthan 4,000 affiliated datasets across nearly 70 distinct platforms, including\nobjects without DOIs and objects without affiliation metadata. However, there\nremain major gaps that stem from suboptimal practices of both researchers and\ndata repositories, many of which were identified in previous studies and which\npersist despite significant investment in efforts to standardize and elevate\nthe quality of datasets and their metadata.",

          "year": "2024-11",
          "abstract": "A large host of scientific journals and conferences solicit peer reviews from\nmultiple reviewers for the same submission, aiming to gather a broader range of\nperspectives and mitigate individual biases. In this work, we reflect on the\nrole of diversity in the slate of reviewers assigned to evaluate a submitted\npaper as a factor in diversifying perspectives and improving the utility of the\npeer-review process. We propose two measures for assessing review utility:\nreview coverage -- reviews should cover most contents of the paper -- and\nreview redundancy -- reviews should add information not already present in\nother reviews. We hypothesize that reviews from diverse reviewers will exhibit\nhigh coverage and low redundancy. We conduct a causal study of different\nmeasures of reviewer diversity on review coverage and redundancy using\nobservational data from a peer-reviewed conference with approximately 5,000\nsubmitted papers. Our study reveals disparate effects of different diversity\nmeasures on review coverage and redundancy. Our study finds that assigning a\ngroup of reviewers that are topically diverse, have different seniority levels,\nor have distinct publication networks leads to broader coverage of the paper or\nreview criteria, but we find no evidence of an increase in coverage for\nreviewer slates with reviewers from diverse organizations or geographical\nlocations. Reviewers from different organizations, seniority levels, topics, or\npublications networks (all except geographical diversity) lead to a decrease in\nredundancy in reviews. Furthermore, publication network-based diversity alone\nalso helps bring in varying perspectives (that is, low redundancy), even within\nspecific review criteria. Our study adopts a group decision-making perspective\nfor reviewer assignments in peer review and suggests dimensions of diversity\nthat can help guide the reviewer assignment process.",

Public access\nto peer review data can benefit both the academic and publishing communities.\nIt also serves as a great support to studies on review comment generation and\nfurther to the realization of automated scholarly paper review. However, most\nof the existing peer review datasets do not provide data that cover the whole\npeer review process. Apart from this, their data are not diversified enough as\nthe data are mainly collected from the field of computer science. These two\ndrawbacks of the currently available peer review datasets need to be addressed\nto unlock more opportunities for related studies. In response, we construct\nMOPRD, a multidisciplinary open peer review dataset. This dataset consists of\npaper metadata, multiple version manuscripts, review comments, meta-reviews,\nauthor's rebuttal letters, and editorial decisions. Moreover, we propose a\nmodular guided review comment generation method based on MOPRD. Experiments\nshow that our method delivers better performance as indicated by both automatic\nmetrics and human evaluation. We also explore other potential applications of\nMOPRD, including meta-review generation, editorial decision prediction, author\nrebuttal generation, and scientometric analysis. MOPRD is a strong endorsement\nfor further studies in peer review-related research and other applications.",

In a top-tier computer science conference (NeurIPS\n2021) with more than 23,000 submitting authors and 9,000 submitted papers, we\nsurvey the authors on three questions: (i) their predicted probability of\nacceptance for each of their papers, (ii) their perceived ranking of their own\npapers based on scientific contribution, and (iii) the change in their\nperception about their own papers after seeing the reviews. The salient results\nare: (1) Authors have roughly a three-fold overestimate of the acceptance\nprobability of their papers: The median prediction is 70% for an approximately\n25% acceptance rate. (2) Female authors exhibit a marginally higher\n(statistically significant) miscalibration than male authors; predictions of\nauthors invited to serve as meta-reviewers or reviewers are similarly\ncalibrated, but better than authors who were not invited to review. (3)\nAuthors' relative ranking of scientific contribution of two submissions they\nmade generally agree (93%) with their predicted acceptance probabilities, but\nthere is a notable 7% responses where authors think their better paper will\nface a worse outcome. (4) The author-provided rankings disagreed with the\npeer-review decisions about a third of the time; when co-authors ranked their\njointly authored papers, co-authors disagreed at a similar rate -- about a\nthird of the time. (5) At least 30% of respondents of both accepted and\nrejected papers said that their perception of their own paper improved after\nthe review process.

The digital space\norganization must be tailored to the methods and the theory of cultural\nheritage, briefly summarized in the introduction. The new ontology is based on\nthe Digital Twin concept, i.e. the digital counterpart of cultural heritage\nassets incorporating all the digital information pertaining to them. This\ncreates a Knowledge Base on the cultural heritage digital space. The paper\noutlines the main features of the proposed Heritage Digital Twin ontology and\nprovides some examples of application.

What are the main\nchallenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies\nand how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data\nmanagement perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review\ntouching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation\nmodels; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance\nInformation (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed\nhistory and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history\nand origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether\nphysical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their\ncreation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe\nthe process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and\nmodelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the\nmany steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects\n(DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework\n(ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability\nand preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and\nMuseum Collections [1] as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital\nTwin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then\ndescribe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be\nthe peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for\nfurther research in this field.",

          "abstract": "Effects of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) quality on historical\ninformation retrieval have so far been studied in data-oriented scenarios\nregarding the effectiveness of retrieval results. Such studies have either\nfocused on the effects of artificially degraded OCR quality (see, e.g., [1-2])\nor utilized test collections containing texts based on authentic low quality\nOCR data (see, e.g., [3]). In this paper the effects of OCR quality are studied\nin a user-oriented information retrieval setting. Thirty-two users evaluated\nsubjectively query results of six topics each (out of 30 topics) based on\npre-formulated queries using a simulated work task setting. To the best of our\nknowledge our simulated work task experiment is the first one showing\nempirically that users' subjective relevance assessments of retrieved documents\nare affected by a change in the quality of optically read text. Users of\nhistorical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data\nquality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for\nstudying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the\nretrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library\nof Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of\none Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to\ncompare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for\ndigitized newspaper articles. The query interface was able to present the same\nunderlying document for the user based on two alternatives: either based on the\nlower OCR quality, or based on the higher OCR quality, and the choice was\nrandomized. The users did not know about quality differences in the article\ntexts they evaluated. The main result of the study is that improved optical\ncharacter recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical\nnewspaper articles significantly. The mean average evaluation score for the\nimproved OCR results was 7.94% higher than the mean average evaluation score of\nthe old OCR results.",

An important step in this process is\nconverting scanned images to text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR),\nwhich can enable further search, information extraction, etc. Unfortunately,\nthis is a hard problem as standard OCR tools are not tailored to deal with\nhistorical orthography as well as with challenging layouts. Thus, it is\nstandard to apply an additional text correction step on the OCR output when\ndealing with such documents. In this work, we focus on Bulgarian, and we create\nthe first benchmark dataset for evaluating the OCR text correction for\nhistorical Bulgarian documents written in the first standardized Bulgarian\northography: the Drinov orthography from the 19th century. We further develop a\nmethod for automatically generating synthetic data in this orthography, as well\nas in the subsequent Ivanchev orthography, by leveraging vast amounts of\ncontemporary literature Bulgarian texts. We then use state-of-the-art LLMs and\nencoder-decoder framework which we augment with diagonal attention loss and\ncopy and coverage mechanisms to improve the post-OCR text correction. The\nproposed method reduces the errors introduced during recognition and improves\nthe quality of the documents by 25\\%, which is an increase of 16\\% compared to\nthe state-of-the-art on the ICDAR 2019 Bulgarian dataset.

Specifically, we investigate the\ncapabilities of mLLMs in performing (1) Optical Character Recognition (OCR),\n(2) OCR Post-Correction, and (3) Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks on a set\nof city directories published in German between 1754 and 1870. First, we\nbenchmark the off-the-shelf transcription accuracy of both mLLMs and\nconventional OCR models. We find that the best-performing mLLM model\nsignificantly outperforms conventional state-of-the-art OCR models and other\nfrontier mLLMs. Second, we are the first to introduce multimodal\npost-correction of OCR output using mLLMs. We find that this novel approach\nleads to a drastic improvement in transcription accuracy and consistently\nproduces highly accurate transcriptions (<1% CER), without any image\npre-processing or model fine-tuning. Third, we demonstrate that mLLMs can\nefficiently recognize entities in transcriptions of historical documents and\nparse them into structured dataset formats. Our findings provide early evidence\nfor the long-term potential of mLLMs to introduce a paradigm shift in the\napproaches to historical data collection and document transcription.",
