          "abstract": "How will superhuman artificial intelligence (AI) affect human decision\nmaking? And what will be the mechanisms behind this effect? We address these\nquestions in a domain where AI already exceeds human performance, analyzing\nmore than 5.8 million move decisions made by professional Go players over the\npast 71 years (1950-2021). To address the first question, we use a superhuman\nAI program to estimate the quality of human decisions across time, generating\n58 billion counterfactual game patterns and comparing the win rates of actual\nhuman decisions with those of counterfactual AI decisions. We find that humans\nbegan to make significantly better decisions following the advent of superhuman\nAI. We then examine human players' strategies across time and find that novel\ndecisions (i.e., previously unobserved moves) occurred more frequently and\nbecame associated with higher decision quality after the advent of superhuman\nAI. Our findings suggest that the development of superhuman AI programs may\nhave prompted human players to break away from traditional strategies and\ninduced them to explore novel moves, which in turn may have improved their\ndecision-making.",

Our main hypothesis is that\npeople rely on human-relevant task features when evaluating AI, treating AI\nfailures on human-easy tasks, and successes on human-difficult tasks, as highly\ninformative of its overall performance. In lab experiments, we show that\nprojection of human difficulty onto AI predictably distorts subjects' beliefs\nand can lead to suboptimal adoption, as failing human-easy tasks need not imply\npoor overall performance for AI. We find evidence for projection in a field\nexperiment with an AI giving parenting advice. Potential users strongly infer\nfrom answers that are equally uninformative but less humanly-similar to\nexpected answers, significantly reducing trust and future engagement. Our\nresults suggest AI \"anthropomorphism\" can backfire by increasing projection and\nde-aligning people's expectations and AI performance.",

          "year": "2025-03",
          "abstract": "This study examines the understudied role of algorithmic evaluation of human\njudgment in hybrid decision-making systems, a critical gap in management\nresearch. While extant literature focuses on human reluctance to follow\nalgorithmic advice, we reverse the perspective by investigating how AI agents\nbased on large language models (LLMs) assess and integrate human input. Our\nwork addresses a pressing managerial constraint: firms barred from deploying\nLLMs directly due to privacy concerns can still leverage them as mediating\ntools (for instance, anonymized outputs or decision pipelines) to guide\nhigh-stakes choices like pricing or discounts without exposing proprietary\ndata. Through a controlled prediction task, we analyze how an LLM-based AI\nagent weights human versus algorithmic predictions. We find that the AI system\nsystematically discounts human advice, penalizing human errors more severely\nthan algorithmic errors--a bias exacerbated when the agent's identity (human vs\nAI) is disclosed and the human is positioned second. These results reveal a\ndisconnect between AI-generated trust metrics and the actual influence of human\njudgment, challenging assumptions about equitable human-AI collaboration. Our\nfindings offer three key contributions. First, we identify a reverse algorithm\naversion phenomenon, where AI agents undervalue human input despite comparable\nerror rates. Second, we demonstrate how disclosure and positional bias interact\nto amplify this effect, with implications for system design. Third, we provide\na framework for indirect LLM deployment that balances predictive power with\ndata privacy. For practitioners, this research emphasize the need to audit AI\nweighting mechanisms, calibrate trust dynamics, and strategically design\ndecision sequences in human-AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Building energy retrofits have been identified as key to realizing climate\nmitigation goals in Canada. This study aims to provide a roadmap for existing\nmid-rise building retrofits in order to understand the required capital\ninvestment, energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon footprint for\nmid-rise residential buildings in Canada. This study employed EnergyPlus to\nexamine the energy performance of 11 energy retrofit measures for a typical\nmulti-unit residential building (MURB) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia,\nCanada. The author employed the energy simulation software (EnergyPlus) to\nevaluate the pre-and post-retrofit operational energy performance of the\nselected MURB. Two base building models powered by natural gas (NG-building)\nand electricity (E-building) were created by SketchUP. The energy simulation\nresults were combined with cost and emission impact data to evaluate the\neconomic and environmental performance of the selected energy retrofit\nmeasures. The results indicated that the NG-building can produce significant\nGHG emission reductions (from 27.64 tCO2e to 3.77 tCO2e) by implementing these\nenergy retrofit measures. In terms of energy savings, solar PV, ASHP, water\nheater HP, and HRV enhancement have great energy saving potential compared to\nother energy retrofit measures. In addition, temperature setback, lighting, and\nairtightness enhancement present the best economic performance from a life\ncycle perspective. However, windows, ASHP, and solar PV, are not economical\nchoices because of higher life cycle costs. While ASHP can increase life cycle\ncosts for the NG-building, with the financial incentives provided by the\ngovernments, ASHP could be the best choice to reduce GHG emissions when\nstakeholders make decisions on implementing energy retrofits.",

          "year": "2021-03",
          "abstract": "There is growing interest in hydrogen (H$_2$) use for long-duration energy\nstorage in a future electric grid dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE)\nresources. Modelling the role of H$_2$ as grid-scale energy storage, often\nreferred as \"power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)\" overlooks the cost-sharing and\nemission benefits from using the deployed H$_2$ production and storage assets\nto also supply H$_2$ for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct\nelectrification may be challenged. Here, we develop a generalized modelling\nframework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment and operation\nacross power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity\nand H$_2$, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and\nsupply. Applying this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a\nrange of technology cost and carbon price scenarios, we find a greater value of\npower-to-H$_2$ (P2G) versus P2G2P routes. P2G provides flexible demand\nresponse, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of P2G2P routes make\nthe solution less attractive for grid balancing. The effects of sector-coupling\nare significant, boosting VRE generation by 12-55% with both increased\ncapacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or\nlevelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. Both\nthe cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with\nH$_2$ demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization\nscenario as H$_2$ demand quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of\ncarbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the H$_2$ sector because\nof the lower cost and higher utilization rate. These findings highlight the\nimportance of using an integrated multi-sector energy system framework with\nmultiple energy vectors in planning energy system decarbonization pathways.",

Yet a\nlittle known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system\nin 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related GHG emissions\nfrom 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the\npandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system,\nrepresenting by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector\nthat reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share\nof energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy,\nwind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the\nfirst time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand\n(-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in\n2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants\nsupply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).\nConcomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored\nlow-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower\nmidday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most\ncountries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since\nrebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus\nto what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon\nintensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.",

Leveraging the German Earnings Survey, a large\nand novel data source comprising around 8 million employee-level observations\nreported by employers each month, we apply a\ndifference-in-difference-in-differences approach to analyze the policy's impact\non hourly wages, monthly earnings, employment, and working hours. Our findings\nreveal significant positive effects on wages, affirming the policy's intended\nbenefits for low-wage workers. Interestingly, we identify a negative effect on\nworking hours, mainly driven by minijobbers. The hours effect results in an\nimplied labor demand elasticity in terms of the employment volume of -0.2 which\nonly partially offsets the monthly wage gains. We neither observe a negative\neffect on the individual's employment retention nor the regional employment\nlevels.",

Using data from two waves\nof the Structure of Earnings Survey allows us to estimate models that account\nfor changes in the minimum wage bite over time.

We apply\ndifferent specifications and extensions of the classic\ndifference-in-differences approach as well as a set of new estimators that\nenables for unbiased effect estimation with a staggered treatment adoption and\nheterogeneous treatment effects. Our results indicate a small negative effect\non dependent employment of 0.5 percent, no significant effect on employment\nsubject to social security contributions, and a significant negative effect of\nabout 2.4 percent on marginal employment until the first quarter of 2022. The\nextended specifications suggest additional effects of the minimum wage\nincreases, as well as stronger negative effects on total dependent and marginal\nemployment for those regions that were strongly affected by the minimum wage in\n2015 and 2019.",

This has prompted\nincreasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm\ndisruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to\ncrises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our\nunderstanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and\ndeterminants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network\nfrom 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model\nthat generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving\nthe total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level.\nWe show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk\nundergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic\nexchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced\nby the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the\nnull value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller\nafterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy.\nFurthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption)\nbecomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international\nlinks cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as\nimports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the\nsupply and demand channels.",

Existing studies\ncaution that these tensions may not meaningfully reduce U.S. dependence on\nChina-linked supply chains. This study examines the drivers of this unmet\nreallocation under overlapping geopolitical and public health disruptions. It\ninvestigates how these shocks jointly reconfigured bilateral trade and global\nvalue chain (GVC) participation and positioning among the U.S., China, and\nmajor trading partners during 2016-2023. Using monthly bilateral trade data\nacross all sectors and multi-regional input-output tables for GVC\ndecomposition, we combine a multi-period event-study with structural analysis\nto evaluate trade-flow disruptions and shifts in participation and functional\npositioning within GVCs. We find that China's exports remained robust, expanded\nacross global markets, and sustained a rise in GVC participation, becoming more\nembedded in upstream segments through increased intermediate shipments to Asia\nand Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. imports increasingly shifted toward \"China+1\"\npartners, especially ASEAN, whose trade structures remain closely tied to\nChinese upstream supply chains. These strengthening triangular relationships\nreveal how global reallocation and GVCs have evolved around the U.S. and China\nacross successive shocks. Based on the evidence, we propose a supply chain\nresilience framework defined by three interacting dimensions: the level of GVC\nparticipation, the functional position within the value chain, and a country's\ncapacity to re-couple in the post-shock landscape, conditioned by market\ndiversification, economic complexity, and institutional capability.

Behavior restrictions disproportionately\nbenefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of\nCOVID-19 and reduction in air pollution.

We use daily\nblockchain and Bitcoin data for 2014-2019 and employ the ARDL approach. We test\nthree equilibrium hypotheses: (i) sensitivity of the Bitcoin blockchain to\nmining reward; (ii) security outcomes of the Bitcoin blockchain and the\nproof-of-work cost; and (iii) the speed of adjustment of the Bitcoin blockchain\nsecurity to deviations from the equilibrium path. Our results suggest that the\nBitcoin price and mining rewards are intrinsically linked to Bitcoin security\noutcomes. The Bitcoin blockchain security's dependency on mining costs is\ngeographically differenced - it is more significant for the global mining\nleader China than for other world regions. After input or output price shocks,\nthe Bitcoin blockchain security reverts to its equilibrium security level.",

          "abstract": "We provide a survey of the Kolkata index of social inequality, focusing in\nparticular on income inequality. Based on the observation that inequality\nfunctions (such as the Lorenz function), giving the measures of income or\nwealth against that of the population, to be generally nonlinear, we show that\nthe fixed point (like Kolkata index k) of such a nonlinear function (or\nrelated, like the complementary Lorenz function) offer better measure of\ninequality than the average quantities (like Gini index). Indeed the Kolkata\nindex can be viewed as a generalized Hirsch index for a normalized inequality\nfunction and gives the fraction k of the total wealth possessed by the rich\n(1-k) fraction of the population. We analyze the structures of the inequality\nindices for both continuous and discrete income distributions. We also compare\nthe Kolkata index to some other measures like the Gini coefficient and the\nPietra index. Lastly, we provide some empirical studies which illustrate the\ndifferences between the Kolkata index and the Gini coefficient.",

          "abstract": "To simultaneously overcome the limitation of the Gini index in that it is\nless sensitive to inequality at the tails of income distribution and the\nlimitation of the inter-decile ratios that ignore inequality in the middle of\nincome distribution, an inequality index is introduced. It comprises three\nindicators, namely, the Gini index, the income share held by the top 10%, and\nthe income share held by the bottom 10%. The data from the World Bank database\nand the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Income\nDistribution Database between 2005 and 2015 are used to demonstrate how the\ninequality index works. The results show that it can distinguish income\ninequality among countries that share the same Gini index but have different\nincome gaps between the top 10% and the bottom 10%. It could also distinguish\nincome inequality among countries that have the same ratio of income share held\nby the top 10% to income share held by the bottom 10% but differ in the values\nof the Gini index. In addition, the inequality index could capture the dynamics\nwhere the Gini index of a country is stable over time but the ratio of income\nshare of the top 10% to income share of the bottom 10% is increasing.\nFurthermore, the inequality index could be applied to other scientific\ndisciplines as a measure of statistical heterogeneity and for size\ndistributions of any non-negative quantities.",

          "year": "2021-11",
          "abstract": "Income inequality is an important issue that has to be solved in order to\nmake progress in our society. The study of income inequality is well received\nthrough the Gini coefficient, which is used to measure degrees of inequality in\ngeneral. While this method is effective in several aspects, the Gini\ncoefficient alone inevitably overlooks minority subpopulations (e.g.\noccupations) which results in missing undetected patterns of inequality in\nminority.\n  In this study, the surveys of incomes and occupations from more than 12\nmillions households across Thailand have been analyzed by using both Gini\ncoefficient and network densities of income domination networks to get insight\nregarding the degrees of general and occupational income inequality issues. The\nresults show that, in agricultural provinces, there are less issues in both\ntypes of inequality (low Gini coefficients and network densities), while some\nnon-agricultural provinces face an issue of occupational income inequality\n(high network densities) without any symptom of general income inequality (low\nGini coefficients). Moreover, the results also illustrate the gaps of income\ninequality using estimation statistics, which not only support whether income\ninequality exists, but that we are also able to tell the magnitudes of income\ngaps among occupations. These results cannot be obtained via Gini coefficients\nalone. This work serves as a use case of analyzing income inequality from both\ngeneral population and subpopulations perspectives that can be utilized in\nstudies of other countries.",
