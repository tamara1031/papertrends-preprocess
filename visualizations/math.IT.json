          "abstract": "Entropy and mutual information in neural networks provide rich information on\nthe learning process, but they have proven difficult to compute reliably in\nhigh dimensions. Indeed, in noisy and high-dimensional data, traditional\nestimates in ambient dimensions approach a fixed entropy and are prohibitively\nhard to compute. To address these issues, we leverage data geometry to access\nthe underlying manifold and reliably compute these information-theoretic\nmeasures. Specifically, we define diffusion spectral entropy (DSE) in neural\nrepresentations of a dataset as well as diffusion spectral mutual information\n(DSMI) between different variables representing data. First, we show that they\nform noise-resistant measures of intrinsic dimensionality and relationship\nstrength in high-dimensional simulated data that outperform classic Shannon\nentropy, nonparametric estimation, and mutual information neural estimation\n(MINE). We then study the evolution of representations in classification\nnetworks with supervised learning, self-supervision, or overfitting. We observe\nthat (1) DSE of neural representations increases during training; (2) DSMI with\nthe class label increases during generalizable learning but stays stagnant\nduring overfitting; (3) DSMI with the input signal shows differing trends: on\nMNIST it increases, while on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 it decreases. Finally, we show\nthat DSE can be used to guide better network initialization and that DSMI can\nbe used to predict downstream classification accuracy across 962 models on\nImageNet.

Therefore, for a given power budget at the RIS, a\nstrengthened RIS-aided link can be achieved by increasing the number of active\nREs as well as amplifying the incident signal.

In 1bCS, linear samples of a high dimensional signal are quantized to\nonly one bit per sample (sign of the measurement). Assuming the original signal\nvector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS either aim to find the support of\nthe vector, or approximate the signal allowing a small error. The focus of this\npaper is support recovery, which often also computationally facilitate\napproximate signal recovery.

With\nuniversality, it is known that $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS measurements are\nnecessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$ denotes the sparsity).\nTo improve the dependence on sparsity from quadratic to linear, in this work we\npropose approximate support recovery (allowing $\\epsilon>0$ proportion of\nerrors), and superset recovery (allowing $\\epsilon$ proportion of false\npositives).

In this paper, we formulate the joint-design\nproblem in MEC networks as an infinite-horizon discounted-cost Markov decision\nprocess and solve it using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework\nthat enables the dynamic orchestration of computing, pushing, and caching.\nThrough the deep networks embedded in the DRL structure, our framework can\nimplicitly predict user future requests and push or cache the appropriate\ncontent to effectively enhance system performance. One issue we encountered\nwhen considering three functions collectively is the curse of dimensionality\nfor the action space. To address it, we relaxed the discrete action space into\na continuous space and then adopted soft actor-critic learning to solve the\noptimization problem, followed by utilizing a vector quantization method to\nobtain the desired discrete action. Additionally, an action correction method\nwas proposed to compress the action space further and accelerate the\nconvergence. Our simulations under the setting of a general single-user,\nsingle-server MEC network with dynamic transmission link quality demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework effectively decreases transmission bandwidth and\ncomputing cost by proactively pushing data on future demand to users and\njointly optimizing the three functions. We also conduct extensive parameter\ntuning analysis, which shows that our approach outperforms the baselines under\nvarious parameter settings.",

Nevertheless, many practical communication systems transmit uniformly\nand independently distributed symbols drawn from regular constellation sets.\nThe introduction of the probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture has\nrenewed interest in using optimized probability distributions, i.e.,\nprobabilistic shaping. Traditionally, probabilistic shaping has been employed\nto reduce the transmit power required for a given information rate over\nadditive noise channels. While this translates into substantive performance\ngains for optical fiber communication systems, the interaction of shaping and\nfiber nonlinearity has posed intriguing questions. At first glance,\nprobabilistic shaping seems to exacerbate nonlinear interference noise (NLIN)\ndue to larger higher-order standardized moments. Therefore, the optimization of\nshaping distributions must differ from those used for linear channels.\nSecondly, finite-length effects related to the memory of the nonlinear fiber\nchannel have been observed. This suggests that the marginal input-symbol\ndistribution is not the only consideration. This paper provides a\ntutorial-style discussion of probabilistic shaping for optical fiber\ncommunication. Since the distinguishing property of the channel is the\nsignal-dependent NLIN, we speak of probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity\ntolerance. Our analysis builds on the first-order time-domain perturbation\napproximation of the nonlinear fiber channel and revisits the notion of linear\nand nonlinear shaping gain. We largely focus on probabilistic amplitude shaping\nwith popular shaping methods. The concept of shaping via sequence selection is\ngiven special consideration, as it inherently optimizes a multivariate\ndistribution for shaped constellations.",

Conventional WPCNs rely\nonly on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically\ninefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation.\nMeanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can\nscavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and\ncellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these\nenergy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the\nabove, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest\nenergy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also\nexploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the\ndedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,\nWPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically\ncharacterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and\nreveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we\nfurther derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is\nactivated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when\nWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on\nthe devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.\nSimulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.",

A major challenge of SWIPT is the\nenergy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive\nlow-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and\nenergy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the\nreceived RF signal is first rectified before being used for information\ndecoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF\ncomponents such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel\nmodulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on\npulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of\nthe pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the\nPeak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's\nnonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the\ninformation can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the\nposition of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the\ninformation and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for\nIntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally.
