We\nstrategically design a two-dimensional crystalline perforated elastic plate,\nusing a square lattice, %consisting of bore holes, that hosts symmetry-induced\ntopological edge states. By concurrently allowing the elastic substrate to\nspatially vary in depth, we are able to convert the incident slow wave into a\nseries of robust modes, with differing envelope modulations. This adiabatic\ntransition localises the incoming energy into a concentrated region where it\ncan then be damped or extracted. For larger transitions, different behaviour is\nobserved; the incoming energy propagates along the interface before being\npartitioned into two disparate chiral beams. This \"topological rainbow\" effect\nleverages two main concepts, namely the quantum valley-Hall effect and the\nrainbow effect usually associated with electromagnetic metamaterials. The\ntopological rainbow effect transcends specific physical systems, hence, the\nphenomena we describe can be transposed to other wave physics. Due to the\ndirectional tunability of the elastic energy by geometry our results have\nfar-reaching implications for applications such as switches, filters and\nenergy-harvesters.",

In this work, elastic-wave higher-order\ntopological states in fractal structures are investigated. Elastic real-space\nquantized quadrupole moment is calculated and used to characterize the topology\nof elastic fractal metamaterials, and formation conditions of topological phase\ntransitions in elastic fractal systems are revealed. The topological edge and\ncorner states of elastic waves in fractal structures are realized theoretically\nand experimentally. It is found that different from the acoustic fractal\nsystem, the topological outer and inner edge states can emerge separately in\nelastic fractal systems, which is important for the integrated sensing and\nparticle manipulation in microfluidics. Besides, the results show that the\nrobustness of the topological corner states in rhombus fractal structures is\nobviously stronger than that in Sierpinski fractal structures, and the physical\nmechanism is clarified. Compared with traditional elastic-wave topological\ninsulators based on periodic structures, the richness of topological states in\nelastic fractal structures is much higher (for the Sierpinski fractal\nstructure, the number of topological states is 156, much greater than that of\nthe periodic structure (only 28)), which is vital in integrated sensing and\nenergy-location applications. The topological phenomena of elastic fractal\nsystems revealed in this work, provides an unprecedented way of controlling\nelastic waves, enriches the topological physics of elastic systems and breaks\nthe limitation of that relying on periodic elastic structures.

Yet to date,\nLiNbO3 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have mostly been fabricated using\nnon-standard etching techniques that lack the reproducibility routinely\nachieved in silicon photonics. Widespread future application of thin-film\nLiNbO3 requires a reliable and scalable solution using standard processing and\nprecise lithographic control. Here we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated\nLiNbO3 photonic platform that overcomes the abovementioned challenges by\nemploying wafer-scale bonding of thin-film LiNbO3 to planarized low-loss\nsilicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits, a mature foundry-grade\nintegrated photonic platform.

The spin\ncurrent injection from the Ta layer can be controlled and even blocked by\nvarying the MgO thickness, but the switching sustains even at a large MgO\nthickness. Furthermore, the switching polarity reverses when the MgO thickness\nexceeds around 3 nm, which cannot be explained by the spin-orbit torque\nscenario due to spin current injection from the Ta layer.

The contrast can be increased by converting the electron beam's\nphase modulation into amplitude modulation using a phase plate, a device that\napplies a $\\pi/2$ radian phase shift to part of the electron beam after it has\npassed through the sample. Previous phase plate designs rely on material placed\nin or near the electron beam to provide this phase shift. This results in image\naberrations, an inconsistent time-varying phase shift, and resolution loss when\nthe electron beam charges, damages, or is scattered from the material.\n  In this thesis, I present the theory, design, and implementation of the laser\nphase plate, which instead uses a focused continuous-wave laser beam to phase\nshift the electron beam.

          "abstract": "In conventional digital computers, data and information are represented in\nbinary form and encoded in the steady states of transistors. They are then\nprocessed in a quasi-static way. However, with transistors approaching their\nphysical limits and the von Neumann bottleneck, the rate of improvement in\ncomputing efficiency has slowed down. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the\ndynamic and adaptive properties of biological systems, research in neural\nmorphology computing has great potential for development. Memristors, a class\nof nonlinear resistors with memory function, naturally embody dynamics through\ntheir internal electrical processes. This enables nonconventional computing\nparadigms with enhanced capability and energy efficiency, such as reservoir\ncomputing. In this paper, we propose a volatile memristor made of LiNbO3 with\nnonlinear I-V characteristics and short-term memory function. This memristor is\nwell-suited to be used as a nonlinear node in the storage layer of reservoir\ncomputing. With this system, we can achieve the same functionality as\ntraditional reservoir computing with a single device, instead of a large number\nof interconnected nodes. The collective states of memristors after the\napplication of trains of pulses to the respective memristors are unique for\neach combination of pulse patterns. This provides a more reliable and efficient\nway for subsequent output layer classification processing. The system was\nsuccessfully used to recognize images of Arabic numerals 0-9. This work not\nonly broadens the application scope of materials such as lithium niobate in\nneural morphology computing but also provides new ideas for developing more\nefficient neural morphology devices and systems.",

          "abstract": "Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories:\nmodel-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies\non macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven\nTSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine\nlearning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the\nacceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the\nintroduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO\nmechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of\ntraffic flow model parameters.
