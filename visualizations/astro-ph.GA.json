It is the largest high-resolution VMP sample\n(including 363 new objects) studied by a single program, and the first attempt\nto accurately determine evolutionary stages for such a large sample based on\nGaia parallaxes. The sample covers a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-1.7\ndown to [Fe/H]=-4.3, including over 110 objects with [Fe/H]<-3.0. The expanded\ncoverage in evolutionary status makes it possible to define abundance trends\nrespectively for giants and turn-off stars. The newly obtained abundance data\nconfirm most abundance trends found by previous studies, but also provide\nuseful update and new sample of outliers. The Li plateau is seen in -2.5 <\n[Fe/H] <-1.7 in our sample, whereas the average Li abundance is clearly lower\nat lower metallicity. Mg, Si, and Ca are overabundant with respect to Fe,\nshowing decreasing trend with increasing metallicity. Comparisons with chemical\nevolution models indicate that the over-abundance of Ti, Sc, and Co are not\nwell reproduced by current theoretical predictions. Correlations are seen\nbetween Sc and alpha-elements, while Zn shows a detectable correlation only\nwith Ti but not with other alpha-elements. The fraction of carbon-enhanced\nstars ([C/Fe]> 0.7) is in the range of 20-30% for turn-off stars depending on\nthe treatment of objects for which C abundance is not determined, which is much\nhigher than that in giants (~8%). Twelve Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0) have\nbeen identified in a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H] =-3.8 through -1.7.\nTwelve Eu-rich stars ([Eu/Fe]> 1.0) have been discovered in -3.4 <[Fe/H]< -2.0,\nenlarging the sample of r-process-enhanced stars with relatively high\nmetallicity.",

          "abstract": "The investigation of the metal-poor tail in the Galactic bulge provides\nunique information on the early Milky Way assembly and evolution. A\nchemo-dynamical analysis of 17 very metal-poor stars (VMP, [Fe/H] $<-2.0$)\nselected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey was carried out based on\nGemini/GRACES spectra. The chemistry suggests that the majority of our stars\nare very similar to metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Orbits calculated\nfrom {\\it Gaia} EDR3 imply these stars are brought into the bulge during the\nearliest Galactic assembly. Most of our stars have large [Na,Ca/Mg] abundances,\nand thus show little evidence of enrichment by pair-instability supernovae. Two\nof our stars (P171457, P184700) have chemical abundances compatible with\nsecond-generation globular cluster stars, suggestive of the presence of ancient\nand now dissolved globular clusters in the inner Galaxy. One of them (P171457)\nis extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<-3.0$) and well below the metallicity floor\nof globular clusters, which supports the growing evidence for the existence of\nlower-metallicity globular clusters in the early Universe. A third star\n(P180956, [Fe/H] $\\sim-2$) has low [Na,Ca/Mg] and very low [Ba/Fe] for its\nmetallicity, which are consistent with formation in a system polluted by only\none or a few low-mass supernovae. Interestingly, its orbit is confined to the\nGalactic plane, like other very metal-poor stars found in the literature, which\nhave been associated with the earliest building blocks of the Milky Way.",

          "abstract": "The chemical composition of planets is inherited from that of the\nprotoplanetary disk at the time of planet formation. Increasing observational\nevidence suggests that planet formation occurs in less than 1 Myr. This\nmotivates the need for spatially resolved spectral observations of Class I\ndisks, as carried out by the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in\nTaurus (ALMA-DOT). In the context of ALMA-DOT, we observe the edge-on disk\naround the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247 (the butterfly star) in the 1.3mm\ncontinuum and five molecular lines. We report the first tentative detection of\nmethanol (CH$_3$OH) in a Class I disk and resolve, for the first time, the\nvertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular tracers. The bulk of the\nemission in the CO 2-1, CS 5-4, and o-H$_2$CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1) lines originates\nfrom the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing\ndisk heights, $z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$. Molecular emission is\nvertically stratified, with CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture\n$z/r\\sim0.41-0.45$) compared to both CS and H$_2$CO, which are nearly cospatial\n($z/r\\sim0.21-0.28$). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to\nmolecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100\n(CO) and 15 (CS). The H$_2$CO emission decreases by a factor of only about 2,\nwhich is possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains, followed by a\nnonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO]\nabundance ratio is 0.5-0.6, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for\nClass 0 hot corinos, and a factor ~2.5 lower than the only other value inferred\nfor a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, 1.3-1.7). Additionally, it is at the\nlower edge but still consistent with the values in comets. This may indicate\nthat some chemical reprocessing occurs in disks before the formation of planets\nand comets.",

          "abstract": "Dust grains play an important role in the synthesis of molecules in the\ninterstellar medium, from the simplest species to complex organic molecules.\nHow some of these solid-state molecules are converted into gas-phase species is\nstill a matter of debate. Our aim is to directly compare ice and gas abundances\nof methanol (CH$_3$OH) and CO, and to investigate the relationship between ice\nand gas in low-mass protostellar envelopes. We present Submillimeter Array and\nAtacama Pathfinder EXperiment observations of gas-phase CH$_3$OH and CO towards\nthe multiple protostellar system IRAS05417+0907 located in the B35A cloud. We\nuse archival AKARI ice data toward the same target to calculate CH$_3$OH and CO\ngas-to-ice ratios. The CO isotopologues emissions are extended, whereas the\nCH$_3$OH emission is compact and traces the giant outflow emanating from\nIRAS05417+0907. A discrepancy between submillimeter dust emission and H$_2$O\nice column density is found for B35A$-$4 and B35A$-$5, similar to what has\npreviously been reported. B35A$-$2 and B35A$-$3 are located where the\nsubmillimeter dust emission peaks and show H$_2$O column densities lower than\nfor B35A$-$4. The difference between the submillimeter continuum emission and\nthe infrared H$_2$O ice observations suggests that the distributions of dust\nand H$_2$O ice differ around the young stellar objects in this dense cloud. The\nreason for this may be that the sources are located in different environments\nresolved by the interferometric observations: B35A$-$2, B35A$-$3 and in\nparticular B35A$-$5 are situated in a shocked region plausibly affected by\nsputtering and heating impacting the submillimeter dust emission pattern, while\nB35A$-$4 is situated in a more quiescent part of the cloud.

Recent\nobservations have demonstrated that various characteristics of the Ly$\\alpha$\nemission line correlate with the inferred LyC escape fraction ($f_{\\rm\nesc}^{\\rm LyC}$) of low-redshift galaxies. Using a data-set of 9,600 mock\nLy$\\alpha$ spectra of star-forming galaxies at $4.64 \\leq z \\leq 6$ from the\nSPHINX$^{20}$ cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulation, we study the\nescape of Ly$\\alpha$ and LyC photons. We find that our mock Ly$\\alpha$\nobservations are representative of high-redshift observations and that typical\nobservational methods tend to over-predict the Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction\n($f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$) by as much as two dex. We investigate the\ncorrelations between $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ and $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$,\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent width ($W_{\\lambda}({\\rm Ly\\alpha})$), peak separation\n($v_{\\rm sep}$), central escape fraction ($f_{\\rm cen}$), and red peak\nasymmetry ($A_f^{\\rm red}$). We find that $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ and\n$f_{\\rm cen}$ are good diagnostics for LyC leakage, selecting for galaxies with\nlower neutral gas densities and less UV attenuation that have recently\nexperienced supernova feedback. In contrast, $W_{\\lambda}({\\rm Ly\\alpha})$ and\n$v_{\\rm sep}$ are found to be necessary but insufficient diagnostics, while\n$A_f^{\\rm red}$ carries little information. Finally, we use stacks of\nLy$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$, and F150W mock surface brightness profiles to find that\ngalaxies with high $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ have less extended Ly$\\alpha$ and\nF150W but larger H$\\alpha$ haloes than their non-leaking counterparts.

The algorithms used for image classification typically rely on\nmultiple costly steps, such as the Point Spread Function (PSF) deconvolution\nand the training and application of complex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nof thousands or even millions of parameters. In our approach, we extract\nfeatures from the galaxy images by analysing the elliptical isophotes in their\nlight distribution and collect the information in a sequence. The sequences\nobtained with this method present definite features allowing a direct\ndistinction between galaxy types, as opposed to smooth S\\'ersic profiles. Then,\nwe train and classify the sequences with machine learning algorithms, designed\nthrough the platform Modulos AutoML, and study how they optimize the\nclassification task. As a demonstration of this method, we use the second\npublic release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR2). We show that by applying it\nto this sample we are able to successfully distinguish between early-type and\nlate-type galaxies, for images with signal-to-noise ratio greater then 300.\nThis yields an accuracy of $86\\%$ for the early-type galaxies and $93\\%$ for\nthe late-type galaxies, which is on par with most contemporary automated image\nclassification approaches.

In the\npresence of a pronounced difference of visual parameters between galaxies from\nthe GZ2 training data set and galaxies without known morphological parameters,\nwe applied novel procedures, which allowed us for the first time to get rid of\nthis difference for smaller and fainter SDSS galaxies.\n  We describe in detail the adversarial validation technique as well as how we\nmanaged the optimal train-test split of galaxies from the training data set.

To improve, we developed a new machine learning\n(ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations.\nOur results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the\nderived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\\sim1/3$ more\naccurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities\nfrom simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS\nYang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to\n$10^{11.5}\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass\nfunction agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived\nstellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with\nthose obtained from direct weak lensing measurements. These new halo mass\nestimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy-halo connection and\nthe role of the halos in galaxy evolution.",

We first show\nthat several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate with the slope of\nthe sMAH ($\\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper\n$\\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted\ngalaxies present larger stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster,\nreach the peak of their star formation histories at higher redshift, and become\nquenched earlier. We also demonstrate that $\\beta$ is more directly connected\nto these key galaxy formation properties than other broadly employed halo\nproxies, such as formation time. Finally, we measure the secondary dependence\nof galaxy clustering on $\\beta$ at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift.\nBy tracing back the evolution of individual haloes, we show that the amplitude\nof the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies\nincreases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of\n$M_\\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

          "abstract": "We use the Delphi semi-analytic model to study the mass assembly and\nproperties of high-redshift ($z>4$) black holes over a wide mass range, $10^3 <\nM_{bh}/M_\\odot < 10^{10}$. Our black hole growth implementation includes a\ncritical halo mass ($M_{h}^{crit}$) below which the black hole is starved and\nabove which it is allowed to grow either at the Eddington limit or\nproportionally to the gas content of the galaxy. As a consequence, after an\ninitial growth phase dominated by black hole mergers down to $z \\sim 7 (9)$,\nsupermassive black holes in $z=4$ halo masses of $M_h|_{z=4} \\sim 10^{11.75} ~\n(10^{13.4}) M_\\odot$ mainly grow by gas accretion from the interstellar medium.\nIn particular, we find that: (i) while most of the accretion occurs in the\nmajor branch for $M_h|_{z=4} \\sim 10^{11-12} M_\\odot$ halos, accretion in\nsecondary branches plays a significant role in assembling the black hole mass\nin higher-mass halos ($M_h|_{z=4} \\gtrsim 10^{12} M_\\odot$); (ii) while the\nEddington ratio increases with decreasing redshift for low-mass ($M_{bh} < 10^5\nM_\\odot$) black holes, it shows the opposite trend for larger masses. In\naddition, since the accretion rate depends on the gas mass present in the host\nhalo, the duty cycle of the Eddington-limited accretion phase -- which can last\nup to $\\approx 650$ Myr -- is crucially linked to the joint assembly history of\nthe black hole and its host halo.",

          "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as\n$10^{6.2-8.1}M_\\odot$ at redshifts of $z \\sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems\nshowing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios >=30%, posing a\ncrucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we\nexplore the combination of {\\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington\naccretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\\it\ncosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an\nalternative path for \"seeding\" early structures and their baryonic contents.\nAssuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\\rm seed}=25$\nand continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be\nexplained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of\n$f_{\\rm Edd}<= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited\naccretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we\nassume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous\nprimordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75}\nM_\\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $<= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with\nobservational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation\nequality ($z \\sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can\nreproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest\nredshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \\sim 10.3$) with the same parameters\ngoverning star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a\nwide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar\nmass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova\nfeedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its\nhost, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early\nsystems.",

We propose a novel mechanism for the\nformation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume\na non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models;\nthese scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially\nformed in the high-$\\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out\nof which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH\naccretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction.\nPBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense\ncore, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading\nto the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\\sim\n20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\\sim 10^7\\ M_\\odot$ corresponding to $\\sim 5-7\\sigma$\nfluctuations), and provides massive ($\\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\\odot}$) seeds by\n$z\\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that\nprovides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\\rm seed}(z)=3.1\\times 10^{5}\\ {\nM_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\\times 10^{9}\\\n{M_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding\nmechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs,\nnamely $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\\sim 6-7$ quasars can\nbe explained with $6\\times 10^4 M_{\\rm \\odot}$ seeds planted at $z\\sim 32$, and\ngrowing at sub-Eddington rates, $\\langle\\lambda_{\\rm E}\\rangle\\sim 0.55$.

          "abstract": "Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars\n([Fe/H]<-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They\nfollow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and\npulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is\nto assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their\npotential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and\nPW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in\nthe Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the\nrelations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs,\nwhile also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on\nnear-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200\nACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds\nsystem (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from\nGaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom\nlight-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes\nfor 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic\nCloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations,\ncalibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find\nthat PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength.\nUsing Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC\nrelative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in\nGalactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph\ngalaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based\ndistances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and\nGaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity\nimpacts.",

In the era of the Hubble Tension, T2C\nvariables with the RR Lyrae stars (RRL) and the tip of the red giant branch\n(TRGB) can potentially provide classical Cepheid independent calibration of the\ncosmic distance ladder. Our goal is to provide an absolute calibration of the\nPeriod-Luminosity, Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Wesenheit\nrelations(PL,PLC and PW) of T2Cs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

The NIR photometry\nwas supplemented with well-sampled optical light curves and accurate pulsation\nperiods from the OGLE IV survey and the Gaia mission.
