We develop an analytic model which makes\nseveral predictions: switchbacks should preferentially occur in regions where\nthe solar wind plasma has undergone a greater expansion, the switchback\nfraction at radii comparable to PSP should be an increasing function of radius,\nand switchbacks should have their gradients preferentially perpendicular to the\nmean magnetic field direction. The expansion of the plasma generates small\ncompressive components as part of the wave's nonlinear evolution: these are\nmaximized when the normalized fluctuation amplitude is comparable to\n$\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the propagation direction and\nthe mean magnetic field. These compressive components steepen the primary\nAlfv\\'enic waveform, keeping the solution in a state of nearly constant\nmagnetic field strength as its normalized amplitude $\\delta B/B$ grows due to\nexpansion. The small fluctuations in the magnetic-field-strength are minimized\nat a particular $\\theta$-dependent value of $\\beta$, usually of order unity,\nand the density and magnetic-field-strength fluctuations can be correlated or\nanticorrelated depending on $\\beta$ and $\\theta$. Example solutions of our\ndynamical equation are presented; some do indeed form magnetic-field reversals.\nOur predictions appear to match some previously unexplained phenomena in\nobservations and numerical simulations, providing evidence that the observed\nswitchbacks result from the nonlinear evolution of the initially\nsmall-amplitude Alfv\\'en waves already known to be present at the coronal base.",

We carry out a statistical survey of the\ndata from the first five orbits of PSP with a focus on how the fluctuation\nproperties at the large, MHD scales, vary with different solar wind streams and\ndistance from the Sun. A more in-depth analysis from several selected periods\nis also presented. Our results show that as fluctuations are transported\noutward by the solar wind, the magnetic field spectrum steepens while the shape\nof the velocity spectrum remains unchanged. The steepening process is\ncontrolled by the \"age\" of the turbulence, determined by the wind speed\ntogether with the radial distance. Statistically, faster solar wind has higher\n\"Alfv\\'enicity\", with more dominant outward propagating wave component and more\nbalanced magnetic/kinetic energies. The outward wave dominance gradually\nweakens with radial distance, while the excess of magnetic energy is found to\nbe stronger as we move closer toward the Sun. We show that the turbulence\nproperties can vary significantly stream to stream even if these streams are of\nsimilar speed, indicating very different origins of these streams. Especially,\nthe slow wind that originates near the polar coronal holes has much lower\nAlfv\\'enicity compared with the slow wind that originates from the active\nregions/pseudostreamers.

          "abstract": "An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship\nbetween switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large\nfluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the\nsolar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of\nturbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we\nexamine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the\npresence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in-situ particle and\nfields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent\nwave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of\nswitchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the\nbackground magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame\n($\\theta_{vB}$) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave\npower parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we\nshow that $\\theta_{vB}$ is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic\ndeflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection\nangle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either\nthe inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks\ndo not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic\nranges via turbulent wave-particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect\nswitchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type\nof energy conversion pathway, although contributions via other mechanisms, such\nas magnetic reconnection may still be significant.",

Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge\nof the CME properties in the inner heliosphere remains constrained by the\nscarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore, most CMEs\nare observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to\ncomplement the sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of\nthe linear force-free spheromak CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial\nevolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context for observational\nstudies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution by\nplacing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain.\nTo directly compare observational and modelling results, we characterise the\ninterplanetary CME signatures between 0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series,\nexploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse real in situ data.\nResults show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME\nvalues is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME\nexpands as a consequence of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the\nexpansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate at larger distances. The early\nrapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size in our\nsimulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak\ngeometry used. The magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME\nduring propagation, while ageing is most probably not a substantial source of\nmagnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that is\nsignificantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA\nprovides a consistent description of the radial evolution of solar wind and\nCMEs; nevertheless, improvements are required to better reproduce the CME\nradial extension.",

          "abstract": "The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great\nimportance to understand their space weather effects. Although many evidences\nsuggest that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of\nevolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the\ninterplanetary space. In this work, we use multi-spacecraft observations and a\nnumerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface\nto understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation\nof its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back\nside of the Sun by coronagraphs, and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the\nMAVEN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux rope-like structure. The simulation\ndiscloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational\nmotion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change\nof axis orientation of the CME's flux rope-like structure. It is also found\nthat the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar\nwind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the\nCME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its\nmagnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary\nspace. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating\ninteraction region (CIR), which makes the orientation of the CME alter, and\nalso deviates from its route due to the CME.

To this end,\nwe incorporate the Gibson-Low CME model within our global MHD model of the\ninner heliosphere, GAMERA-Helio. We apply the model to study the propagation of\nthe geoeffective CME that erupted on 3 April, 2010 with the aim to reproduce\nthe temporal variations of the magnetic field vector during the CME passage by\nEarth.

For an\nin-ecliptic direction, the simulation shows a rotation of all three magnetic\nfield components within the CME, as seen at Earth, similar to that observed.\nWith a southward propagation direction, suggested by coronal imaging\nobservations, the modeled By and Bz components are consistent with the ACE\ndata, but the Bx component lacks the observed change from negative to positive.\nIn both cases, the model favors the East-West orientation of the CME flux rope,\nconsistent with the orientation previously inferred from the STEREO/HI\nheliospheric images.",

We then\nuse data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter to compare induced magnetic fields at\nVenus with those at Mars. At Venus, the vertical structure of the magnetic\nfield tends to exist in one of two states (magnetized or unmagnetized) but we\nfind the induced fields at Mars are more complicated, and we are unable to use\nthis simple classification scheme.

The\nlow-altitude field strength at Venus tends to be higher than Mars.

For Mars, low-altitude field strengths\nare higher than expected given these assumptions.

          "abstract": "The magnetic activity of a star -- which modulates the stellar wind outflow\n-- shapes the immediate environments of orbiting planets and induces\natmospheric loss thereby impacting their habitability. We perform a detailed\nparameter space study using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nto understand the effect of changing stellar wind magnetic field and planetary\nmagnetic field strengths on planetary magnetospheric topology and atmospheric\nlosses. It is observed that the relative strengths of stellar and planetary\nmagnetic fields play a significant role in determining the steady state\nmagnetospheric configuration and atmospheric erosion. When the stellar field is\nstrengthened or the planetary field is weakened, stellar magnetic field\naccumulation occurs at the day-side of the planet which forces the magnetopause\nto shift closer to its surface. The magnetotail opens up leading to the\nformation of Alfv\\'{e}n wings in the night-side wake region. We demonstrate how\nreconnection processes and wind conditions lead to the bifurcation of the\nmagnetotail current sheet. With increasing stellar wind magnetic field\nstrength, the day-side reconnection point approaches the planet thereby\nenhancing mass loss. We establish an analytic equation which successfully\ncaptures the modeled mass-loss rate variations of planets with changing\nmagnetic field strengths.

This\nresearch addresses: (i) determination of the minimum-time low-thrust trajectory\nand (ii) design, implementation, and testing of a guidance and control\narchitecture, for a space vehicle that travels from Gateway to LLO. Orbit\ndynamics is described in terms of modified equinoctial elements, in the context\nof a high-fidelity ephemeris model.

In order to meet the established\nrequirements and constraints while maintaining a low fuel cost, the use of\nlow-energy trajectories is particularly interesting. These allow spacecraft to\nchange orbits and move with little to no fuel, but they are computed using\nmotion models of a higher fidelity than the commonly used two-body problem\n(2BP). For this purpose, perturbation methods that explore the third-body\neffect are especially attractive, since they can accurately convey the system\ndynamics of a three-body configuration with a lower computational cost, by\nemploying mapping techniques or exploring analytical approximations.\n  The focus of this work is to broaden the knowledge of low-energy trajectories\nby developing new mathematical tools to assist in mission design applications.\nIn particular, novel motion models based on the third-body effect are\nconceived. One application of this study focuses on the trajectory design for\nmissions to near-Earth asteroids.

A solar eruption on 17 April 2021 produced a widespread Solar\nEnergetic Particle (SEP) event that was observed by five longitudinally\nwell-separated observers in the inner heliosphere at heliocentric distances of\n0.42 to 1 au: BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, and\nnear-Earth spacecraft. The event produced relativistic electrons and protons.\nIt was associated with a long-lasting solar hard X-ray flare and a medium fast\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME) with a speed of 880 km/s driving a shock, an EUV\nwave as well as long-lasting radio burst activity showing four distinct type\nIII burst. Methods. A multi-spacecraft analysis of remote-sensing and in-situ\nobservations is applied to attribute the SEP observations at the different\nlocations to the various potential source regions at the Sun. An ENLIL\nsimulation is used to characterize the interplanetary state and its role for\nthe energetic particle transport. The magnetic connection between each\nspacecraft and the Sun is determined.

Radio observations are used to\ncharacterize the directivity of the four main injection episodes, which are\nthen employed in a 2D SEP transport simulation. Results. Timing analysis of the\ninferred SEP solar injection suggests different source processes being\nimportant for the electron and the proton event. Comparison among the\ncharacteristics and timing of the potential particle sources, such as the\nCME-driven shock or the flare, suggests a stronger shock contribution for the\nproton event and a more likely flare-related source of the electron event.\nConclusions. We find that in this event an important ingredient for the wide\nSEP spread was the wide longitudinal range of about 110 degrees covered by\ndistinct SEP injections.",

This change in the memory of the polar field from multi- to\none-cycle with the increase of the super-criticality of the dynamo is\nindependent of the importance of various turbulent transport processes in the\nmodel. We further show that when the dynamo operates near the critical, it\nproduces frequent extended episodes of weaker activity, resembling the solar\ngrand minima. The occurrence of grand minima is accompanied by the multi-cycle\ncorrelation of polar field. The frequency of grand minima decreases with the\nincrease of supercriticality of the dynamo.",
