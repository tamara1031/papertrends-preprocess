Research regarding (efficient) algorithms for computing\nGr\\\"obner bases spans a large body of dedicated work that stretches over the\nlast six decades. The pioneering work of Bruno Buchberger in 1965 can be\nconsidered as the blueprint for all subsequent Gr\\\"obner basis algorithms to\ndate. Among the most efficient algorithms in this line of work are\nsignature-based Gr\\\"obner basis algorithms, with the first of its kind\npublished in the late 1990s by Jean-Charles Faug\\`ere under the name F5. In\naddition to signature-based approaches, Rusydi Makarim and Marc Stevens\ninvestigated a different direction to efficiently compute Gr\\\"obner bases,\nwhich they published in 2017 with their algorithm M4GB. The ideas behind M4GB\nand signature-based approaches are conceptually orthogonal to each other\nbecause each approach addresses a different source of inefficiency in\nBuchberger's initial algorithm by different means.\n  We amalgamate those orthogonal ideas and devise a new Gr\\\"obner basis\nalgorithm, called M5GB, that combines the concepts of both worlds. In that\ncapacity, M5GB merges strong signature-criteria to eliminate redundant S-pairs\nwith concepts for fast polynomial reductions borrowed from M4GB. We provide\nproofs of termination and correctness and a proof-of-concept implementation in\nC++ by means of the Mathic library. The comparison with a state-of-the-art\nsignature-based Gr\\\"obner basis algorithm (implemented via the same library)\nvalidates our expectations of an overall faster runtime for quadratic\noverdefined polynomial systems that have been used in comparisons before in the\nliterature and are also part of cryptanalytic challenges.",

Therefore, cryptographers have to resort\nto experiments, extrapolations and hypotheses to assess the security of their\ndesigns. One established measure to quantify the complexity of linear\nalgebra-based Gr\\\"obner basis algorithms is the so-called solving degree.\nCaminata \\& Gorla revealed that under a certain genericity condition on a\npolynomial system the solving degree is always upper bounded by the\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity and henceforth by the Macaulay bound, which only\ntakes the degrees and number of variables of the input polynomials into\naccount. In this paper we extend their framework to iterated polynomial\nsystems, the standard polynomial model for symmetric ciphers and hash\nfunctions. In particular, we prove solving degree bounds for various attacks on\nMiMC, Feistel-MiMC, Feistel-MiMC-Hash, Hades and GMiMC. Our bounds fall in line\nwith the hypothesized complexity of Gr\\\"obner basis attacks on these designs,\nand to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a mathematical\nproof for these complexities is provided.\n  Moreover, by studying polynomials with degree falls we can prove lower bounds\non the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for attacks on MiMC, Feistel-MiMC and\nFeistel-MiMC-Hash provided that only a few solutions of the corresponding\niterated polynomial system originate from the base field.

          "abstract": "A Puiseux monoid is an additive submonoid of the nonnegative cone of rational\nnumbers. Although Puiseux monoids are torsion-free rank-one monoids, their\natomic structure is rich and highly complex. For this reason, they have been\nimportant objects to construct crucial examples in commutative algebra and\nfactorization theory. In 1974 Anne Grams used a Puiseux monoid to construct the\nfirst example of an atomic domain not satisfying the ACCP, disproving Cohn's\nconjecture that every atomic domain satisfies the ACCP. Even recently, Jim\nCoykendall and Felix Gotti have used Puiseux monoids to construct the first\natomic monoids with monoid algebras (over a field) that are not atomic,\nanswering a question posed by Robert Gilmer back in the 1980s.\n  This dissertation is focused on the investigation of the atomic structure and\nfactorization theory of Puiseux monoids. Here we established various sufficient\nconditions for a Puiseux monoid to be atomic (or satisfy the ACCP). We do the\nsame for two of the most important atomic properties: the finite-factorization\nproperty and the bounded-factorization property. Then we compare these four\natomic properties in the context of Puiseux monoids. This leads us to construct\nand study several classes of Puiseux monoids with distinct atomic structure.\nOur investigation provides sufficient evidence to believe that the class of\nPuiseux monoids is the simplest class with enough complexity to find monoids\nsatisfying almost every fundamental atomic behavior.",

          "abstract": "A submonoid of the additive group $\\mathbb{Q}$ is called a Puiseux monoid if\nit consists of nonnegative rationals. Given a monoid $M$, the set consisting of\nall nonempty finite subsets of $M$ is also a monoid under the Minkowski sum,\nand it is called the (finitary) power monoid of $M$. In this paper we study\natomicity and factorization properties in power monoids of Puiseux monoids. We\nspecially focus on the ascent of the property of being atomic and both the\nbounded and the finite factorization properties (the ascending chain on\nprincipal ideals and the length-finite factorization properties are also\nconsidered here). We prove that both the bounded and the finite factorization\nproperties ascend from any Puiseux monoid to its power monoid. On the other\nhand, we construct an atomic Puiseux monoid whose power monoid is not atomic.\nWe also prove that the existence of maximal common divisors for nonempty finite\nsubsets is a sufficient condition for the property of being atomic to ascend\nfrom a Puiseux monoid to its power monoid.",

An integral domain is called\natomic if every nonzero nonunit factors into irreducibles. Atomic domains that\ndo not satisfy the ascending chain condition on principal ideals (ACCP) have\nproved to be elusive, and not many of them have been found since the first one\nwas constructed by A. Grams in 1974. Here we exhibit the first class of atomic\nrings of integer-valued polynomials without the ACCP. An integral domain is\ncalled a finite factorization domain (FFD) if it is simultaneously atomic and\nan idf-domain (i.e., every nonzero element is divisible by only finitely many\nirreducibles up to associates). We prove that a ring is an FFD if and only if\nits ring of integer-valued polynomials is an FFD. In addition, we show that\nneither being atomic nor being an idf-domain transfer, in general, from an\nintegral domain to its ring of integer-valued polynomials. In the same class of\nrings of integer-valued polynomials, we consider further properties that are\ndefined in terms of divisibility by irreducibles, including being\nCohen-Kaplansky and being Furstenberg.",
