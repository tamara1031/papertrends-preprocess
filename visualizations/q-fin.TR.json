          "abstract": "Liquidity providers are essential for the function of decentralized exchanges\nto ensure liquidity takers can be guaranteed a counterparty for their trades.\nHowever, liquidity providers investing in liquidity pools face many risks, the\nmost prominent of which is impermanent loss. Currently, analysis of this metric\nis difficult to conduct due to different market maker algorithms, fee\nstructures and concentrated liquidity dynamics across the various exchanges. To\nthis end, we provide a framework to generalize impermanent loss for multiple\nasset pools obeying any constant function market maker with optional\nconcentrated liquidity. We also discuss how pool fees fit into the framework,\nand identify the condition for which liquidity provisioning becomes profitable\nwhen earnings from trading fees exceed impermanent loss. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the utility and generalizability of this framework with simulations\nin BalancerV2 and UniswapV3.",

          "abstract": "Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new type of trading venues which are\nrevolutionising the way market participants interact. At present, the majority\nof AMMs are constant function market makers (CFMMs) where a deterministic\ntrading function determines how markets are cleared. Within CFMMs, we focus on\nconstant product market makers (CPMMs) which implements the concentrated\nliquidity (CL) feature. In this thesis we formalise and study the trading\nmechanism of CPMMs with CL, and we develop liquidity provision and liquidity\ntaking strategies. Our models are motivated and tested with market data.\n  We derive optimal strategies for liquidity takers (LTs) who trade orders of\nlarge size and execute statistical arbitrages. First, we consider an LT who\ntrades in a CPMM with CL and uses the dynamics of prices in competing venues as\nmarket signals. We use Uniswap v3 data to study price, liquidity, and trading\ncost dynamics, and to motivate the model. Next, we consider an LT who trades a\nbasket of crypto-currencies whose constituents co-move. We use market data to\nstudy lead-lag effects, spillover effects, and causality between trading\nvenues.\n  We derive optimal strategies for strategic liquidity providers (LPs) who\nprovide liquidity in CPMM with CL. First, we use stochastic control tools to\nderive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy\nwhere the width of the LP's liquidity range is determined by the profitability\nof the pool, the dynamics of the LP's position, and concentration risk. Next,\nwe use a model-free approach to solve the problem of an LP who provides\nliquidity in multiple CPMMs with CL. We do not specify a model for the\nstochastic processes observed by LPs, and use a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nneural network to approximate the optimal liquidity provision strategy.",

          "abstract": "We present a mathematical formulation of liquidity provision in decentralized\nexchanges. We focus on constant function market makers of utility indifference\ntype, which include constant product market makers with concentrated liquidity\nas a special case. First, we examine no-arbitrage conditions for a liquidity\npool and compute an optimal arbitrage strategy when there is an external liquid\nmarket. Second, we show that liquidity provision suffers from impermanent loss\nunless a transaction fee is levied under the general framework with\nconcentrated liquidity. Third, we establish the well-definedness of\narbitrage-free reserve processes of a liquidity pool in continuous-time and\nshow that there is no loss-versus-rebalancing under a nonzero fee if the\nexternal market price is continuous. We then argue that liquidity provision by\nmultiple liquidity providers can be understood as liquidity provision by a\nrepresentative liquidity provider, meaning that the analysis boils down to that\nfor a single liquidity provider. Last, but not least, we give an answer to the\nfundamental question in which sense the very construction of constant function\nmarket makers with concentrated liquidity in the popular platform Uniswap v3 is\noptimal.",

          "abstract": "This research systematically develops and evaluates various hybrid modeling\napproaches by combining traditional econometric models (ARIMA and ARFIMA\nmodels) with machine learning and deep learning techniques (SVM, XGBoost, and\nLSTM models) to forecast financial time series. The empirical analysis is based\non two distinct financial assets: the S&P 500 index and Bitcoin. By\nincorporating over two decades of daily data for the S&P 500 and almost ten\nyears of Bitcoin data, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of\nforecasting methodologies across different market conditions and periods of\nfinancial distress. Models' training and hyperparameter tuning procedure is\nperformed using a novel three-fold dynamic cross-validation method. The\napplicability of applied models is evaluated using both forecast error metrics\nand trading performance indicators. The obtained findings indicate that the\nproper construction process of hybrid models plays a crucial role in developing\nprofitable trading strategies, outperforming their individual components and\nthe benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. The most effective hybrid model architecture\nwas achieved by combining the econometric ARIMA model with either SVM or LSTM,\nunder the assumption of a non-additive relationship between the linear and\nnonlinear components.",

Traditional models such\nas ARIMA and GARCH perform well with linear data but struggle with non-linear\ndependencies. Machine learning and deep learning models, particularly Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, address these challenges by capturing\nintricate patterns and long-term dependencies. This report compares ARIMA and\nLSTM models in predicting the S&P 500 index, a major financial benchmark.\n  Using historical price data and technical indicators, we evaluated these\nmodels using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The\nARIMA model showed reasonable performance with an MAE of 462.1, RMSE of 614,\nand 89.8 percent accuracy, effectively capturing short-term trends but limited\nby its linear assumptions. The LSTM model, leveraging sequential processing\ncapabilities, outperformed ARIMA with an MAE of 369.32, RMSE of 412.84, and\n92.46 percent accuracy, capturing both short- and long-term dependencies.\nNotably, the LSTM model without additional features performed best, achieving\nan MAE of 175.9, RMSE of 207.34, and 96.41 percent accuracy, showcasing its\nability to handle market data efficiently.\n  Accurately predicting stock movements is crucial for investment strategies,\nrisk assessments, and market stability. Our findings confirm the potential of\ndeep learning models in handling volatile financial data compared to\ntraditional ones. The results highlight the effectiveness of LSTM and suggest\navenues for further improvements. This study provides insights into financial\nforecasting, offering a comparative analysis of ARIMA and LSTM while outlining\ntheir strengths and limitations.",

However,\nthis task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the\noriginal data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price\nmovement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We\nobserved that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid\nsides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower\ncomplexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose\na novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the\nperformance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing\nthe ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.\nWe applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines\nand validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks\nin the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention\n(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate\nits role in modeling stock price movements.
