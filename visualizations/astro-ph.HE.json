We present high-energy NuSTAR\nobservations of 9 Seyfert 2 AGN from the IRAS 12 micron survey, supplemented\nwith low-energy X-ray observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift.

The analysis\nof the two XMM-Newton observations performed in September 2023, six days apart,\ndid not detect IGR J17503-2636, allowing us to pose the most stringent 3sigma\nupper limit on the source flux to date (~9.5x10^-14 erg/cm2/s, 2-10 keV, flux\ncorrected for absorption). This value implies that the amplitude of the X-ray\nflux variability exceeds a factor of ~2100, compared with the discovery\noutburst in 2018.

In particular, the RXTorus model with a sub-solar metallicity\nsuggests the obscuring column to be almost Compton-thick. We compared the\n$2-10$ keV intrinsic X-ray luminosity with the inferred X-ray luminosities\nbased on empirical scaling relations for unobscured AGNs using $L_{\\rm\n[OIV](25.89\\mu {\\rm m})}$, $L_{[{\\rm OIII}](5007 {\\rm angstrom})}$, and\n$L_{6\\rm \\mu m}$ and found that the high-excitation $[{\\rm OIV}]$ line provides\na better estimate of the intrinsic $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity ($L_{2-10}^{\\rm\nint} \\sim 10^{41.41}{\\rm erg s}^{-1}$).

          "abstract": "With its last observing run, the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has\ndetected almost one hundred gravitational waves from compact binary\ncoalescences. A common approach to studying the population properties of the\nobserved binaries is to use phenomenological models to describe the spin, mass,\nand redshift distributions. More recently, with the aim of providing a clearer\nlink to astrophysical processes forming the observed compact binaries\ncoalescences, several authors have proposed to employ synthetic catalogs for\npopulation studies. In this paper, we review how to employ and interpret\nsynthetic binary catalogs for gravitational-wave progenitors studies. We\ndescribe how to build multi-channel merger rates and describe their associated\nprobabilities focusing on stellar progenitor properties. We introduce a method\nto quantify the match between the phenomenological reconstruction of merger\nrates with synthetic catalogs. We detail the implementation of synthetic\ncatalogs for multi-channel hierarchical Bayesian inference, highlighting\ncomputational aspects and issues related to hyper-prior choice. We find that\nwhen inferring stellar progenitors' properties from gravitational-wave\nobservations, the relative efficiency in compact objects production should be\ntaken into account. Finally, by simulating binary black hole detections with\nLIGO and Virgo sensitivity expected for the O4 observing run, we present two\ncase studies related to the inference of the common envelope efficiency and\nprogenitor metallicity of the binary black holes.

          "abstract": "To unlock the full spectrum of astrophysical and cosmological applications of\ngravitational-wave detections, it is essential to localise the associated\nblack-hole mergers to high precision inside their host galaxies. One possible\nmethod to achieve this is to compare the properties of multiple detections of\ngravitationally-lensed binary black-hole merger events with the properties of\nstrong gravitational lens systems located in the joint sky localisation of the\ngravitational-wave detections. In this work, we simulate the population of\nbinary black-hole mergers lensed by galaxy-scale lenses and detectable by\nLIGO-Virgo-Kagra in the coming decade and the population of galaxy-scale strong\nlenses that will be detected by Euclid. We use these simulations to investigate\nthe prospects for localising strongly lensed binary black-hole mergers inside\nthe lensed galaxies of 'Euclid-like' galaxy-scale strong lenses. We find that\nfor 20-50% of strongly lensed gravitational wave events the lens system is\ndetectable with Euclid, if the event falls in its survey footprint. Of these,\nwe expect to correctly identify the strongly-lensed host galaxy as likely (with\nposterior probability) host galaxy - based on Bayesian evidence ranking of\ncandidate hosts - for 34.6-21.9% of quadruply-lensed gravitational-wave events\nwhen given an a-priori 1-5 deg^2 gravitational-wave-only sky localisation. For\ntriply and doubly lensed gravitational-wave events, this becomes 29.8-14.9% and\n16.4-6.6% respectively. If successfully identified, however, the localisation\ncan be better than a fraction of the host-galaxy size, i.e. of order\nmilli-arcseconds.

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients of extraordinary\nluminosity. Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently\nobserved in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class.\nFor example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate\nthe rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission.\nPeriodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently\nreported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery\nof FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced\nby 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important\nclues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that\nof FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the\nmain FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A\ncomponents to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these\nagainst the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with\nsub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from\nrepeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the\nperiodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5$\\sigma$. Its\nrepeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the\nrequired spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star\nequations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict\nwith a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could,\nhowever, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a\nmagnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the\nsmallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star\nrotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.",

As part of the\nPRECISE repeater localization program on the EVN, we monitored FRB 20190208A\nfor 65.6 hours at $\\sim1.4$ GHz and detected a single burst, which led to its\nVLBI localization with 260 mas uncertainty (2$\\sigma$). Follow-up optical\nobservations with the MMT Observatory ($i\\gtrsim 25.7$ mag (AB)) found no\nvisible host at the FRB position. Subsequent deeper observations with the GTC,\nhowever, revealed an extremely faint galaxy ($r=27.32 \\pm0.16$ mag), very\nlikely ($99.95 \\%$) associated with FRB 20190208A.

Unlike the other\nrepeaters with low-luminosity hosts, FRB 20190208A has a modest Faraday\nrotation measure of a few tens of rad m$^{-2}$, and EVN plus VLA observations\nreveal no associated compact persistent radio source.

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short (millisecond) radio pulses originating\nfrom enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances so far lacking a detection in\nother energy bands. Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered\nas the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because\nof differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar\ncharacteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE\nsatellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very\nbright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected\nby AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is\nspectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~\n$10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first\ntime that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like\nradio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit\nX-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be\ndiscovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR\n1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of\nrepeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may\npower the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique\noccasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on\nthe X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs.

The pressure rises rapidly in the regime of baryon density $n \\sim$ 2-4\ntimes nuclear saturation density, $n_0$ -- the region where we expect hadronic\nmatter to be undergoing transformation into quark matter -- and the pressure in\nthe nuclear regime is greater than predicted by microscopic many-body\nvariational calculations of nuclear matter. To incorporate these insights into\nthe microscopic physics from the nuclear to the quark matter regimes, we\nconstruct an equation of state, QHC21, within the framework of quark-hadron\ncrossover (QHC). We include nuclear matter results primarily based on the\nstate-of-the-art chiral effective field theory, but also note results of using\nnuclear matter variational calculations based on empirical nuclear forces. We\nemploy explicit nuclear degrees of freedom only up to $n \\sim 1.5n_0$, in order\nto explore the possibility of further physical degrees of freedom than\nnucleonic here. The resulting QHC21, which has a peak in sound velocity in\n$\\sim 2$-$4 n_0$, is stiffer than the earlier QHC19 below 2$n_0$, predicting\nlarger radii in substantial agreement with the NICER data.",

          "abstract": "Context: GRB 211106A and GRB 211227A are recent gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with\ninitial X-ray positions suggesting associations with nearby galaxies (z < 0.7).\nTheir prompt emission characteristics indicate GRB 211106A is a short-duration\nGRB and GRB 211227A is a short GRB with extended emission, likely originating\nfrom compact binary mergers. However, classifying solely based on prompt\nemission can be misleading. Aims: These short GRBs in the local Universe offer\nopportunities to search for associated kilonova (KN) emission and study host\ngalaxy properties in detail. Methods: We conducted deep optical and NIR\nfollow-up using ESO-VLT FORS2, HAWK-I, and MUSE for GRB 211106A, and ESO-VLT\nFORS2 and X-Shooter for GRB 211227A, starting shortly after the X-ray afterglow\ndetection. We performed photometric analysis to look for afterglow and KN\nemissions associated with the bursts, along with host galaxy imaging and\nspectroscopy. Optical/NIR results were compared with Swift X-Ray Telescope\n(XRT) and other high-energy data. Results: For both GRBs we placed deep limits\nto the optical/NIR afterglow and KN emission. Host galaxies were identified:\nGRB 211106A at photometric z = 0.64 and GRB 211227A at spectroscopic z = 0.228.\nHost galaxy properties aligned with typical short GRB hosts. We also compared\nthe properties of the bursts with the S-BAT4 sample to further examined the\nnature of these events. Conclusions: Study of prompt and afterglow phases,\nalong with host galaxy analysis, confirms GRB 211106A as a short GRB and GRB\n211227A as a short GRB with extended emission. The absence of optical/NIR\ncounterparts is likely due to local extinction for GRB 211106A and a faint\nkilonova for GRB 211227A.",

Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation,\nand relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs\nas massive as $10^4$ M$_\\odot$. This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs\naccrete a substantial fraction of the stellar mass captured during each\ncollision and (2) that the rate at which new stars are introduced into the\nregion near the SMBH is high enough to offset depletion by stellar disruptions\nand star-star collisions. We discuss deviations from these key assumptions in\nthe text. Our results suggest that BHs in the pair-instability mass gap and\nIMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centers. This formation channel has\nimplications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce\nelectromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal\ndisruption events.

Compared to the equal stellar mass model, the\nmulti-mass model tends to result in a higher average mass of disrupted stars.\nInstead of being tidally disrupted by the SMBH, roughly half of the captured\nmain sequence stars will directly plunge into the SMBH because of their small\nstellar radius.

For energies above those achievable in human-made\naccelerators, hadronic interactions are only accessible through the studies of\nextensive air showers, which can be measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory.\nWith its hybrid detector design, the Pierre Auger Observatory measures both the\nlongitudinal development of showers in the atmosphere and the lateral\ndistribution of particles that arrive at the ground. This way, observables that\nare sensitive to hadronic interactions at ultra-high energies can be obtained.\nWhile the hadronic interaction cross-section can be assessed from the\nlongitudinal profiles, the number of muons and their fluctuations measured with\nthe ground detectors are linked to other physical properties. In addition to\nthese direct studies, we discuss here how measurements of the atmospheric depth\nof the maximum of air-shower profiles and the characteristics of the muon\nsignal at the ground can be used to test the self-consistency of the post-LHC\nhadronic models.",

          "abstract": "The Pierre Auger Observatory is the world's largest detector for observation\nof ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) (above the energy of $10^{17}$ eV).\nIt consists of a Fluorescence Detector (FD) and an array of particle detectors\nknown as the Surface Detector (SD). Observations of extensive air showers by\nthe Observatory can be used to probe hadronic interactions at high energy, in a\nkinematic and energy region inaccessible to experiments at man-made\naccelerators and to measure the muon component of the shower. Air showers\ninduced by different primaries have different muon contents. With increasing\nmass of the primary cosmic ray particle, it is expected that the muon content\nin the corresponding air showers should also increase. Recent results obtained\nfrom the Pierre Auger Observatory and other experiments indicate that all the\nshower simulations underestimate the number of muons in the showers compared to\nthe data. This is the so-called muon deficit. In this paper we briefly review\nthe muon measurements, and present in more detail recent results on\nfluctuations in the muon number. These results provide new insights into the\norigin of the muon deficit in air shower simulations and constrain the models\nof hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies. With the current design of the\nsurface detectors it is also difficult to reliably separate the contributions\nof muons to the SD signal from the contributions of photons, electrons, and\npositrons. Therefore, we also present a new method to extract the muon\ncomponent of the signal time traces recorded by each SD station using recurrent\nneural networks. The combination of such algorithms, with the future data\ncollected by the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory, will be a major step\nforward, as we are likely to achieve an unprecedented resolution in mass\nestimation on an event-by-event basis.",

When a BH becomes saturated with large-scale vertical\nmagnetic flux, it enters a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state. The\ndynamically-important BH magnetic flux powers highly efficient relativistic\noutflows (or jets) and sporadically erupts from the BH into the disk midplane.\nHere we explore the evolution of MADs when the BH and gas angular momentum are\nmisaligned, which is expected to be more common. Using numerical simulations,\nwe find that jets from rapidly spinning, prograde BHs force the inner accretion\nflow into alignment with the BH spin via the magneto-spin alignment mechanism\nfor disks initially misaligned at $\\mathcal{T}\\lesssim 60^{\\circ}$. Extremely\nmisaligned MAD disks, on the other hand, exhibit intermittent jets that blow\nout parts of the disk to $\\approx 100$ gravitational radii before collapsing,\nleaving behind hot cavities and magnetized filaments. These intermittent jet\nmechanism forms a mini-feedback cycle and could explain some cases of X-ray and\nradio quasi-periodic eruptions observed in dim AGN. Further, we find that (i)\nfor BHs with low power jets, the BH spin and initial disk tilt angle changes\nthe amount of horizon magnetic flux, and (ii) geometrically-thick, misaligned\naccretion flows do not undergo sustained Lense-Thirring (LT) precession.\nThereby, we suggest that low-luminosity accreting BHs ($\\dot{M}\\ll 10^{-3}\n\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$) are not likely to exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations in\nlightcurves due to LT precession, in agreement with observations of BH X-ray\nbinaries and AGN in the low-hard/quiescent state.

Recent\nstudies have indicated that strong flavor conversions can occur inside neutrino\nspheres where neutrinos are tightly coupled to matter. These flavor conversions\nare associated with either collisional instability or fast neutrino-flavor\nconversion (FFC) or both. The impact of these flavor conversions on CCSN\ndynamics is, however, still highly uncertain due to the lack of global\nsimulations of quantum kinetic neutrino transport with appropriate\nmicrophysical inputs. Given fluid profiles from a recent CCSN model at three\ndifferent time snapshots in the early post-bounce phase, we perform global\nquantum kinetic simulations in spherical symmetry with an essential set of\nmicrophysics.

We find that the angular structure\nof the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by\na flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend\non the degree of mixing. In this paper we examine the effect of subdominant\ntoroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak\nfields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of\nthe mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout\nstructure.
