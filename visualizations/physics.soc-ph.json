          "abstract": "COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global\npandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths\nacross the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the\nsymptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely,\nasymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no\nsymptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy\nindividuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major\nobstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious\ndisease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of\nCOVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type\nepidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix\nrepresenting contact structures among different age groups of the population.\nImpact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown\nstrategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the\ndisease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model\nis matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the\npurpose of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown\nis seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.",

          "abstract": "This study develops a framework for quantification of the impact of changes\nin population mobility due to social distancing on the COVID-19 infection\ngrowth rate. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological\nmodel we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19\ndeaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19\ninfections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is\na function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that\npredicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population\nmobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth\nrate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the\nmobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which\nCOVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model\non publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded\n100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google\nMobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the\ncountry level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be\naccurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit\ncategory of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence\ninterval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of\nthe pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction\nin population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic.\nMoreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a\nreadily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful\nindicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.",

          "abstract": "COVID-19 has devastated the entire global community. Vaccines present an\nopportunity to mitigate the pandemic; however, the effect of vaccination\ncoupled with the behavioral response of the population is not well understood.\nWe propose a model that incorporates two important dynamically varying\npopulation behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of caution\nincreases with the number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense of\nsafety with increased vaccination lowers precautionary behaviors. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively reproduce the\ncomplete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the United\nStates and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the population\nbehavior and disease transmission rates. We propose a parameter d_I as a direct\nmeasure of a population's caution against an infectious disease, that can be\nobtained from the ongoing new infectious cases. The model provides a method for\nquantitative measure of critical infectious disease attributes for a population\nincluding highest disease transmission rate, effective disease transmission\nrate, and disease related precautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19\npandemic trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout and\nbehavioral response. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quickly\nend the pandemic, we find that a return towards pre-pandemic social behavior\ndue to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment, can cause an\nalarming surge in infections. Our results indicate that at the current rate of\nvaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States will\napproach zero by the end of August 2021. The model can be used for predicting\nfuture epidemic and pandemic dynamics before and during vaccination.",

          "abstract": "The analysis of complex and time-evolving interactions like social dynamics\nrepresents a current challenge for the science of complex systems. Temporal\nnetworks stand as a suitable tool to schematise such systems, encoding all the\nappearing interactions between pairs of individuals in discrete time. Over the\nyears, network science has developed many measures to analyse and compare\ntemporal networks. Some of them imply a decomposition of the network into small\npieces of interactions, i.e. only involving a few nodes for a short time range.\nAlong this line, a possible way to decompose a network is to assume an\negocentric perspective, i.e. to consider for each node the time evolution of\nits neighbourhood. This has been proposed by Longa et al. by defining the\n\"egocentric temporal neighbourhood\", which has proven a useful tool to\ncharacterise temporal networks relative to social interactions. However, this\ndefinition neglects group interactions (quite common in social domains) as they\nare always decomposed into pairwise connections.A more general framework that\nallows us to consider also larger interactions is represented by higher-order\nnetworks. Here, we generalise the description of social interactions by making\nuse of hypergraphs, consequently, we generalise its decomposition into \"hyper\negocentric temporal neighbourhoods\". This will allow us to analyse social\ninteractions, to compare different datasets or different nodes inside a\ndataset, by taking into account the intrinsic complexity represented by\nhigher-order interactions. Even if we limit the order of interactions to the\nsecond (triplets of nodes), our results reveal the importance of a higher-order\nrepresentation. In fact, our analyses show second-order structures are\nresponsible for the majority of the variability at all scales: between\ndatasets, amongst nodes and over time.",

To identify the importance of higher-order\ninteractions in the evolution of networks, we compare both artificial and\nreal-world data to a model based on pairwise interactions only. The significant\ndifferences between the computed matrix and the calculated matrix from the\nfitted parameters demonstrate that non-pairwise interactions exist for various\nreal-world systems in space and time, such as our data sets. Furthermore, this\nalso reveals that different patterns of higher-order interaction are involved\nin different real-world situations.\n  To test our approach, we then use these transition matrices as the basis of a\nlink prediction algorithm. We investigate our algorithm's performance on four\ntemporal networks, comparing our approach against ten other link prediction\nmethods. Our results show that higher-order interactions in both space and time\nplay a crucial role in the evolution of networks as we find our method, along\nwith two other methods based on non-local interactions, give the best overall\nperformance.

          "abstract": "In urban streets, the intrusion of pedestrians presents significant safety\nchallenges. Modelling mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic is complex due to the\ndistinct motion characteristics and spatial dimensions of pedestrians and\nvehicles, making unified modelling difficult, with few studies addressing these\nissues. This paper employs a multi-grid cellular automata model to bridge the\ngap between vehicle and pedestrian models. An Improved Kerner-Klenov-Wolf\n(IKKW) model and a pedestrian motion model that incorporates Time-To-Collision\n(TTC) are introduced. Both models update the spatial motions of vehicles and\npedestrians uniformly. Empirical analysis indicates that the model achieves\nhigh simulation accuracy. This model effectively illustrates the impact of\npedestrian intrusion within mixed traffic scenario. The fundamental diagram of\nheterogeneous traffic reveals substantial differences, highlighting the effects\nof pedestrian intrusion on traffic flow states and identifying six phase\nregions in mixed traffic. Additionally, this paper examines conflicts between\npedestrians and vehicles under varying speed limits and sidewalk widths,\ndemonstrating that lower speeds and broader sidewalks significantly reduce the\nfrequency of pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Notably, the frequency of peak\nconflicts at a vehicle speed limit of 60.48 km/h is more than three times\nhigher than at 30.24 km/h.

This issue has historically been left to administrative\ncriteria, which can vary significantly across countries and political systems,\nhindering a comparative analysis across urban systems. However, the wide use of\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) has now allowed the\ndevelopment of new quantitative approaches to unveil how social dynamics\nrelates to urban infrastructure. In fact, ICT provide the potential to portray\nmore accurate descriptions of the urban systems based on the empirical analysis\nof millions of traces left by urbanites across the city. In this work, we apply\ncomputational techniques over a large volume of mobile phone records to define\nurban boundaries, through the analysis of travel patterns and the trajectory of\nurban dwellers in conurbations with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Chile. We\ncreated and analyzed the network of interconnected places inferred from\nindividual travel trajectories. We then ranked each place using a spectral\ncentrality method. This allowed to identify places of higher concurrency and\nfunctional importance for each urban environment. Urban scaling analysis is\nfinally used as a diagnostic tool that allowed to distinguish urban from\nnon-urban spaces. The geographic assessment of our method shows a high\ncongruence with the current and administrative definitions of urban\nagglomerations in Chile.

Metal fuels, such as iron (Fe), are\npromising solutions for a clean energy supply, but establishing an\ninterconnected ecosystem still requires considerable research and development.\nA model is proposed to assess the supply chain of hydrogen and iron as clean,\ncarbon-free energy carriers and then examines case studies of possible trade\nroutes between the potential energy exporters Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and\nAustralia and importers Germany and Japan. The work comprehends the assessment\nof economic (levelized cost of electricity - LCOE), energetic (thermodynamic\nefficiency) and environmental (CO$_2$ emissions) aspects, quantified by the\ncomprehensive model accounting for the most critical processes in the supply\nchain. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses identify the main drivers for\nenergy costs. Iron is shown to be lower-cost and more efficient to transport in\nlonger routes and for long-term storage, but potentially more expensive and\nless efficient than H$_2$ to produce and convert. Uncertainties related to the\nsupply chain specifications and the sensitivity to the used variables indicate\nthat the path to viable energy carriers fundamentally depends on efficient\nsynthesis, conversion, storage, and transport. A break-even analysis\ndemonstrated that clean energy carriers could be competitive with conventional\nenergy carriers at low renewable energy prices, while carbon taxes might be\nneeded to level the playing field. Thereby, green iron is an important\npotential energy carrier for long-distance trade in a globalized clean energy\nmarket.",

          "abstract": "The ambitious energy target to achieve climate-neutrality in the European\nUnion (EU) energy system raises the feasibility question of using only\nrenewables across all energy sectors. As one of the EU's leading industrialized\ncountries, Germany has adopted several climate-action plans for the realistic\nimplementation and maximum utilization of renewable energies in its energy\nsystem. The literature review shows a clear gap in comprehensive techniques\ndescribing an open modeling approach for analyzing fully renewable and\nsector-coupled energy systems. This paper outlines a method for analyzing the\n100% renewable-based and sector-coupled energy system's feasibility in Germany.\nBased on the open energy modeling framework, an hourly optimization tool\n'OSeEM-DE' is developed to investigate the German energy system. The model\nresults show that a 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled system for\nelectricity and building heat is feasible in Germany. The investment capacities\nand component costs depend on the parametric variations of the developed\nscenarios. The annual investment costs vary between 17.6 and 26.6 bn Euro/yr\nfor volatile generators and between 23.7 and 28.8 bn Euro/yr for heat\ngenerators. The model suggests an investment of a minimum of 2.7-3.9 bn Euro/yr\nfor electricity and heat storage. Comparison of OSeEM-DE results with recent\nstudies validates the percentage-wise energy mix composition and the calculated\nLevelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values from the model. Sensitivity\nanalyses indicate that storage and grid expansion maximize the system's\nflexibility and decrease the investment cost. The study concludes by showing\nhow the tool can analyze different energy systems in the EU context.",

It is also the global leader in\nrapid per capita annual deployment of new solar and wind energy, which is\ncausing the country's emissions to decline. Australia is located at\nlow-moderate latitudes along with three quarters of the global population.\nThese factors make the Australian experience globally significant. In this\nstudy, we model a fully decarbonised electricity system together with complete\nelectrification of heating, transport and industry in Australia leading to an\n80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. An energy supply-demand balance is\nsimulated based on long-term (10 years), high-resolution (half-hourly)\nmeteorological and energy demand data. A significant feature of this model is\nthat short-term off-river energy storage and distributed energy storage are\nutilised to support the large-scale integration of variable solar and wind\nenergy. The results show that high levels of energy reliability and\naffordability can be effectively achieved through a synergy of flexible energy\nsources; interconnection of electricity grids over large areas; response from\ndemand-side participation; and mass energy storage.

These models are crucial for studying opinion\nformation and collective behavior on social media, especially in conjunction\nwith branching theory.\n  For instance, Galam's Ising model applies principles from physics to social\nsciences, representing individual opinions as \"spins\" and illustrating how\nlocal interactions influence consensus formation. The Bounding Confidence model\nconsiders opinions within a confidence interval, showing how opinions converge\nor polarize.\n  These models effectively analyze opinion dynamics in online communities,\naiding in understanding trends and viral phenomena on social media.

In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion\ndynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and\ngroups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through\nboth dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we\nfind that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable\nopinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in\na network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size\neffects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We\ndevelop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with\ndirect numerical simulations. We also show -- both numerically and via our\nmean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number\nof dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated.\nOur results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can\nhave important effects on collective opinion dynamics.",

In this work, the diversity of strategies is introduced into the\nweak prisoners' dilemma game, which is measured by the diversity of the\ncooperation tendency.

The complete cooperation strategy is the full cooperation tendency\nand the complete defection strategy is without any cooperation tendency.

The numerical simulation shows that increasing the\ndiversity of the cooperation tendency promotes the cooperation level, not only\nthe number of cooperators but also the average tendency over the whole\npopulation, until the diversity reaches its saturated value. Furthermore, our\nwork points out maintaining cooperation is based on the cooperation efficiency\napproximating to the reward of cooperators and that the cooperation efficiency\noscillates and quickly decreases to zero when cooperator clusters cannot resist\nthe invasion of defectors.

          "abstract": "Food security is a critical issue closely linked to human being. With the\nincreasing demand for food, international trade has become the main access to\nsupplementing domestic food shortages, which not only alleviates local food\nshocks, but also exposes economies to global food crises. In this paper, we\nconstruct four temporal international crop trade networks (iCTNs) based on\ntrade values of maize, rice, soybean and wheat, and describe the structural\nevolution of different iCTNs from{ {1993}} to 2018. We find that the size of\nall the four iCTNs expanded from{ {1993}} to 2018 with more participants and\nlarger trade values. Our results show that the iCTNs not only become tighter\naccording to the increasing in network density and clustering coefficient, but\nalso get more similar. We also find that the iCTNs are not always\ndisassortative, unlike the world cereal trade networks and other international\ncommodity trade networks. The degree assortative coefficients depend on degree\ndirections and crop types. The analysis about assortativity also indicates that\neconomies with high out-degrees tend to connect with economies with low\nin-degrees and low out-degrees. Additionally, we compare the structure of the\nfour iCTNs to enhance our understanding of the international food trade system.\nAlthough the overall evolutionary patterns of different iCTNs are similar, some\ncrops exhibit idiosyncratic trade patterns. It highlights the need to consider\ndifferent crop networks' idiosyncratic features while making food policies. Our\nfindings about the dynamics of the iCTNs play an important role in\nunderstanding vulnerabilities in the global food system.",

          "abstract": "Recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have\nexposed vulnerabilities and caused disruptions of supply chains, leading to\nproduct shortages, increased costs, and economic instability. This has prompted\nincreasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm\ndisruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to\ncrises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our\nunderstanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and\ndeterminants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network\nfrom 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model\nthat generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving\nthe total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level.\nWe show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk\nundergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic\nexchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced\nby the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the\nnull value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller\nafterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy.\nFurthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption)\nbecomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international\nlinks cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as\nimports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the\nsupply and demand channels.",

          "abstract": "International food trade is a growing complement to gaps in domestic food\nsupply and demand, but it is vulnerable to disruptions due to some unforeseen\nshocks. This paper assembles the international crop trade networks using maize,\nrice, soybean, and wheat trade data sets from 1986 to 2020. We assess the\nimportance of economies using multidimensional node importance metrics. We\nanalyze the correlation structure of different node important metrics based on\nthe random matrix theory and incorporate 20 metrics into a single metric. We\nfind that some metrics have many similarities and dissimilarities, especially\nfor metrics based on the same trade flow directions. We also find that European\neconomies have a significant impact on the iCTNs. Additionally, economies with\npoor crop production play a major role in import trade, whereas economies with\nhigher food production or smaller populations are crucial to export trade. Our\nfindings have practical implications for identifying key economies in the\ninternational crop trade networks, preventing severe damage to the food trade\nsystem caused by trade disruptions in some economies, maintaining the stability\nof the food supply, and ensuring food security.",

          "abstract": "In view of some persistent recent reports on a singular kind of growth of the\nworld wealth inequality, where a finite (often handful) number of people tend\nto possess more than the wealth of the planet's 50\\% population, we explore\nhere if the kinetic exchange models of the market can ever capture such\nfeatures where a significant fraction of wealth can concentrate in the hands of\na countable few when the market size $N$ tends to infinity. One already\nexisting example of such a kinetic exchange model is the Chakraborti or\nYard-Sale model, where (in absence of tax redistribution etc) the entire wealth\ncondenses in the hand of one (for any value of $N$), and the market dynamics\nstops. With tax redistribution etc, its steady state dynamics have been shown\nto have remarkable applicability in many cases of our extremely unequal world.\nWe show here that another kinetic exchange model (called here the Banerjee\nmodel) has intriguing intrinsic dynamics, by which only ten rich traders or\nagents possess about 99.98\\% of the total wealth in the steady state (without\nany tax etc like external manipulation) for any large value of $N$. We will\ndiscuss in some detail the statistical features of this model using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We will also show, if the traders each have a non-vanishing\nprobability $f$ of following random exchanges, then these condensations of\nwealth (100\\% in the hand of one agent in the Chakraborti model, or about\n99.98\\% in the hands ten agents in the Banerjee model) disappear in the large\n$N$ limit. We will also see that due to the built-in possibility of random\nexchange dynamics in the earlier proposed Goswami-Sen model, where the exchange\nprobability decreases with an inverse power of the wealth difference of the\npair of traders, one did not see any wealth condensation phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Social and economic inequality is a plague of the XXI Century. It is\ncontinuously widening, as the wealth of a relatively small group increases and,\ntherefore, the rest of the world shares a shrinking fraction of resources. This\nsituation has been predicted and denounced by economists and econophysicists.\nThe latter ones have widely used models of market dynamics which consider that\nwealth distribution is the result of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A\nsimple analogy relates the wealth in a society with the kinetic energy of the\nmolecules in a gas, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between\nthe molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems, thanks to\nthe equipartition of energy, the gas eventually arrives at an equilibrium\nstate, in many exchange models the economic system never equilibrates. Instead,\nit moves toward a \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all\nthe wealth of the society and the rest of agents shares zero or a very small\nfraction of the total wealth. Here we discuss two ways of avoiding the\n\"condensed\" state. On one hand, we consider a regulatory policy that favors the\npoorest agent in the exchanges, thus increasing the probability that the wealth\ngoes from the richest to the poorest agent. On the other hand, we study a tax\nsystem and its effects on wealth distribution. We compare the redistribution\nprocesses and conclude that complete control of the inequalities can be\nattained with simple regulations or interventions.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of wealth inequality propels us to characterize its origin and\nprogression, via empirical and theoretical studies. The Yard-Sale(YS) model, in\nwhich a portion of the smaller wealth is transferred between two individuals,\nculminates in the concentration of almost all wealth to a single individual,\nwhile distributing rest of the wealth with a power-law of exponent one. By\nincorporating redistribution to the model, in which the transferred wealth is\nproportional to the sender's wealth, we show that such extreme inequality is\nsuppressed if the frequency ratio of redistribution to the YS-type exchange\nexceeds the inverse of the population size. Studying our model on a\nsparsely-connected population, we find that the wealth inequality ceases to\ngrow for a period, when local rich nodes can no longer acquire wealth from\ntheir broke nearest neighbors. Subsequently, inequality resumes growth due to\nthe redistribution effect by allowing locally amassed wealth to move and\ncoalesce. Analyzing the Langevin equations and the coalescing random walk on\ncomplex networks, we elucidate the scaling behaviors of wealth inequality in\nthose multiple phases. These findings reveal the influence of network structure\non wealth distribution, offering a novel perspective on wealth inequality.",

          "abstract": "The recent growth of the space sector, spurred by a surge in private actors,\nhas led to a sharp increase in our ability to address societal challenges\nthrough space data. However, this has exacerbated an already critical situation\nin space: the proliferation of space debris and a critical expansion of space\ntraffic which is leading to high levels of orbital congestion. In parallel,\nincreased levels of spacecraft production and orbital launches are also\nheightening the environmental footprint of the sector. This might lead to a\nparadoxical situation whereby the use of space to support the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) becomes unsustainable from the perspective of both the\nEarth and space environment. This situation can be described as the space\nsustainability paradox. This paper presents this concept for the first time and\nargues that existing policies and remediation actions are not a long-term\nsustainable solution for tackling this issue and may actually intensify the\nproblem. This places an added importance upon addressing space sustainability\nin a more coherent, strategic and responsible manner, potentially based on the\ndoughnut economic model of social and planetary boundaries. Doing so may\nprevent the sector from falling victim to a tragedy of the commons type of\nscenario and avoid negative trends from becoming the norm.
