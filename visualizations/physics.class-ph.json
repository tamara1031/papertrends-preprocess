          "abstract": "The geometrical Berry phase is key to understanding the behaviour of quantum\nstates under cyclic adiabatic evolution. When generalised to non-Hermitian\nsystems with gain and loss, the Berry phase can become complex, and should\nmodify not only the phase but also the amplitude of the state. Here, we perform\nthe first experimental measurements of the adiabatic non-Hermitian Berry phase,\nexploring a minimal two-site $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian that is\ninspired by the Hatano-Nelson model. We realise this non-Hermitian model\nexperimentally by mapping its dynamics to that of a pair of classical\noscillators coupled by real-time measurement-based feedback. As we verify\nexperimentally, the adiabatic non-Hermitian Berry phase is a purely geometrical\neffect that leads to significant amplification and damping of the amplitude\nalso for non-cyclical paths within the parameter space even when all\neigenenergies are real. We further observe a non-Hermitian analog of the\nAharonov--Bohm solenoid effect, observing amplification and attenuation when\nencircling a region of broken $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry that serves as a source\nof imaginary flux. This experiment demonstrates the importance of geometrical\neffects that are unique to non-Hermitian systems and paves the way towards the\nfurther studies of non-Hermitian and topological physics in synthetic\nmetamaterials.",

Most existing studies, however, focus on non-Hermitian eigenstates,\nwhereas dynamic properties of non-Hermitian systems have been discussed only\nvery recently, predicting unexpected phenomena such as wave self-healing,\nchiral Zener tunneling, and the dynamic NHSEs that are not yet confirmed in\nexperiments. Here, we report the first experimental observation of rich\nnon-Hermitian skin dynamics using tunable one-dimensional nonreciprocal\ndouble-chain mechanical systems with glide-time symmetry. Remarkably, dynamic\nNHSEs are observed with various dynamic behaviors in different dynamic phases,\nrevealing the intriguing nature of these phases that can be understood via the\ngeneralized Brillouin zone and the related concepts. Moreover, the observed\ntunable non-Hermitian skin dynamics and amplifications, the bulk unidirectional\nwave propagation, and the boundary wave trapping provide promising ways to\nguide, trap, and amplify waves in a controllable and robust way.

A modification of the coupling term in the\nDirac equation is proposed, that makes the equation work with both real\npotentials.

Since the presentation of the\nspecial theory of relativity, it has been commonly accepted that a famous\nformula E = mc^2 = m_0c^2 /(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) expresses the energy of a free\nparticle only. However, while studying the experiment for the annihilation of\nparticle and antiparticle and the production of the photon in terms of the law\nof energy conservation of particle and field, we obtain a conclusion that E\nincludes not only the energy of a free particle but also the energy of its self\n-fields (electromagnetic field and gravitational field). Hence, a formula for\nthe energy in the special theory of relativity comes to have a more inclusive\nmeaning than Einstein had thought of it. Based upon such an idea and the\ncorrespondence principle, through introducing a new non-Euclidean\nfour-dimensional space, so-called KR space in which the metric is the function\nof coordinates and 4-velocity, we reformulate the action function to be a\nfunction defined in the nonlinear version and from it find equation system for\na charge and the field with a modified version, which is reduced to that in the\nMaxwell theory under the weak field condition: here, weak field condition is\ngiven by |U/m_0c^2|<<1, U; interactional energy. With the equation system, we\nshow that the divergence problem arising from the Maxwell theory, without\ninvoking renormalization, is very naturally solved by sensible mathematics and\nthen demonstrate that the total energy of a free charge and its field equals\nmc^2 and so the energy of an electrostatic field leads to the finite. In this\ncourse are derived the modified version of Coulomb potential and of radiation\nreaction without renormalization which contains an interference effect (a\nnonlinear effect that does not obey LSP).",

In\nparticular, a design paradigm is established for artificial materials where\nfollower forces, so far ignored in homogenization schemes, are introduced as\nloads prestressing an elastic two-dimensional grid made up of linear elastic\nrods (reacting to elongation, flexure and shear). A rigorous application of\nFloquet-Bloch wave asymptotics yields an unsymmetric acoustic tensor governing\nthe \\textit{incremental} dynamics of the effective material. The latter is\ntherefore the incremental response of a hypo-elastic solid, which does not\nfollow from a strain potential and thus does not belong to hyper-elasticity.\nThrough the externally applied follower forces (which could be originated via\ninteraction with a fluid, or gas, or by application of Coulomb friction, or\nnon-holonomic constraints), the artificial material may adsorb/release energy\nfrom/to the environment and therefore produce energy in a closed strain loop,\nwithout violating any rule of thermodynamics. The solid is also shown to\ndisplay flutter, a material instability corresponding to a Hopf bifurcation,\nwhich was advocated as possible in plastic solids, but never experimentally\nfound and so far believed to be impossible in elasticity.",

A cloud of unresolved\nquestions surrounding the foundations of the theory could lead an impartial\nobserver to conclude that statistical thermodynamics is in a state of crisis\nthough.

Definitions are proposed for\nall of the extrinsic variables of the fundamental thermodynamic relation that\nare consistent with existing results in the equilibrium thermodynamic limit.\nThe probability density function on the phase space is interpreted as a\nsubjective uncertainty about the microstate, and the Gibbs entropy formula is\nmodified to allow for entropy creation without introducing additional physics\nor modifying the phase space dynamics. Resolutions are proposed to the mixing\nparadox, Gibbs' paradox, Loschmidt's paradox, and Maxwell's demon thought\nexperiment. Finally, the extrinsic variables of the fundamental thermodynamic\nrelation are evaluated as functions of time and space for a diffusing ideal\ngas, and the initial and final values are shown to coincide with the expected\nequilibrium values when interpreted in a classical context.",

          "abstract": "The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of materials\nbecomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and other\nsimilar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third\nlaw. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by\nregarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many\ninconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to\nthese inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law\nwithout any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature\nof entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only\nwhen thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are\nTCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for\nsolids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On\nthis basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of\natoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be\nassigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by\ndiscrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations.\nAmong various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at\nsufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration,\nwhich do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that\nregion. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by\nexpressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes\nat $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended\nspace including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high\ntemperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained\nthrough several debates on the glass transition.",

Usually, such phenomena\nare studied by kinetic theory and their energy properties are considered\n\"trivial\". In current research, we show that, beyond the boundary of the second\nlaw of thermodynamics where Boltzmann's H-theorem does not apply, there are\nalso large-sized systems of nontrivial energy properties: when the system is\nisolated, entropy can decrease; from a single thermal reservoir, the system can\nabsorb heat and produce useful work without any other effect. The key concept\nis local nonchaoticity, demonstrated by using a narrow energy barrier. The\nbarrier width is much less than the nominal particle mean free path, so that\ninside the barrier, the particle-particle collisions are sparse and the\nparticle trajectories tend to be locally nonchaotic. Across the barrier, the\nsteady-state particle flux ratio is intrinsically in a non-Boltzmann form. With\na step-ramp structure, the nonequilibrium effect spreads to the entire system,\nand a global flow is generated spontaneously from the random thermal motion.\nThe deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is steady and significant, and\ncompatible with the basic principle of maximum entropy. These theoretical and\nnumerical analyses may shed light on the fundamentals of thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics.",

In\nparticular, we provide a geometric generalization of Kepler's third law, and\ngive a similar law for the apsidal angle, for any isochrone orbit. We also\nrelate the set of isochrone orbits to the set of parabolae in the plane under\nlinear transformations, and use this to derive an analytical parameterization\nof any isochrone orbit.

          "abstract": "In the problem of cylinder rolling without slipping on a horizontal floor,\nboth the cylinder and floor are generally treated as rigid bodies in normal\ntextbooks. When the air resistance is ignored, the equation of motion has a\nsolution with a constant velocity. However, in the real world, permanent motion\ndoes not occur. The difficulty cannot be solved only by the horizontal force,\nbecause a horizontal force opposite the translational direction increases the\nangular velocity of rotation around the center. Therefore other mechanisms need\nto be examined. There are two main reasons for this result. 1) Both a cylinder\nand a floor are not perfect circle and perfect plane, but have uneven surfaces.\nThe micro bumps on the surface yield small collisions in the direction\nperpendicular to the floor. The collisions generate a rolling friction torque\naround the center. 2) A strong force acts on the contact part which is\ndeformed. The high-speed deformation produces a history effect on the\nrelationship between stress and strain, because the compressed wave in the\ncontact part diffuses to the outside at the speed of sound. Therefore a rolling\nfriction torque is also generated. Both torques are caused by forces\nperpendicular to the floor. The rolling friction torque eliminates the\ndiscrepancy between the textbook results and reality by solving the\nsimultaneous differential equations of rotation and translation.
