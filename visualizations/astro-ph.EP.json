          "abstract": "The TRAPPIST-1 system is home to at least seven terrestrial planets and is a\ntarget of interest for future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations.\nAdditionally, these planets will be of interest to future missions making\nobservations in the ultraviolet (UV). Although several of these planets are\nlocated in the traditional habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on\nthe surface, TRAPPIST-1h is interesting to explore as a potentially habitable\nocean world analog. In this study, we evaluate the observability of a\nTitan-like atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1h. The ability of the JWST or a future UV\nmission to detect specific species in the atmosphere at TRAPPIST-1h will depend\non how far each species extends from the surface. In order to understand the\nconditions required for detection, we evaluate the input parameters used in\none-dimensional models to simulate the structure of Titan-like atmospheres.\nThese parameters include surface temperature and pressure, temperature profile\nas a function of distance from the surface, composition of the minor species\nrelative to N 2, and the eddy diffusion coefficient. We find that JWST\nsimulated spectra for cloud- and haze-free atmospheres are most sensitive to\nsurface temperature, temperature gradients with altitude, and surface pressure.\nThe importance of temperature gradients in JWST observations shows that a\nsimple isothermal scale height is not ideal for determining temperature or\natmospheric mean molecular mass in transit spectra from exoplanet atmospheres.\nWe demonstrate that UV transmission spectra are sensitive to the upper\natmosphere, where the exobase can be used to approximate the vertical extent of\nthe atmosphere.",

          "year": "2020-05",
          "abstract": "Ultra-hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperature greater than 2000K are\nuniquely interesting targets as they provide us crucial insights into how\natmospheres behave under extreme conditions. This class of giant planets\nreceives intense radiation from their host star and usually has strongly\nirradiated and highly inflated atmospheres. At such high temperature, cloud\nformation is expected to be suppressed and thermal dissociation of water vapor\ncould occur. We observed the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b with 7 transits and 5\neclipses using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and $Spitzer$ for a\ncomprehensive study of its atmospheric chemical and physical processes. We\ndetect TiO and H$_2$O absorption in the optical and near-infrared transit\nspectrum. Additional absorption by a number of neutral and ionized heavy metals\nlike Fe, Ni, Ti, and SiO help explain the short wavelength transit spectrum.\nThe secondary eclipse spectrum shows muted water feature but a strong CO\nemission feature in Spitzer's 4.5 $\\mu$m band indicating an inverted\ntemperature pressure profile. We analyzed both the transit and emission\nspectrum with a combination of self-consistent PHOENIX models and retrieval\nmodels (ATMO $\\&$ PLATON). Both spectra are well fitted by the self-consistent\nPHOENIX forward atmosphere model in chemical and radiative equilibrium at solar\nmetallicity, adding to the growing evidence that both TiO/VO and NUV heavy\nmetals opacity are prominent NUV-optical opacity sources in the stratospheres\nof ultra-hot Jupiters.",

          "year": "2023-07",
          "abstract": "Ultra-hot Jupiters are perfect targets for transmission spectroscopy.\nHowever, their atmospheres feature strong spatial variations in temperature,\nchemistry, dynamics, cloud coverage, and scale height. This makes transit\nobservations at high spectral resolution challenging to interpret. In this\nwork, we model the cross-correlation signal of five chemical species (Fe, CO,\nH$_\\text{2}$O, OH, and TiO) on WASP-76b, a benchmark ultra-hot Jupiter. We\ncompute phase-dependent high-resolution transmission spectra of 3D SPARC/MITgcm\nmodels. The spectra are obtained with gCMCRT, a 3D Monte-Carlo\nradiative-transfer code. We find that, on top of atmospheric dynamics, the\nphase-dependent Doppler shift of the absorption lines in the planetary rest\nframe is shaped by the combined effect of planetary rotation and the unique 3D\nspatial distribution of chemical species. For species probing the dayside\n(e.g., refractories or molecules like CO and OH), the two effects act in\ntandem, leading to increasing blueshifts with orbital phase. For species that\nare depleted on the dayside (e.g., H$_\\text{2}$O and TiO), the two effects act\nin an opposite manner, and could lead to increasing redshifts during the\ntransit. This behaviour yields species-dependent offsets from a planet's\nexpected $K_\\text{p}$ value that can be much larger than planetary wind speeds.\nThe offsets are usually negative for refractory species. We provide an\nanalytical formula to estimate the size of a planet's $K_\\text{p}$ offsets,\nwhich can serve as a prior for atmospheric retrievals. We conclude that\nobserving the phase-resolved absorption signal of multiple species is key to\nconstraining the 3D thermochemical structure and dynamics of ultra-hot\nJupiters.",

          "year": "2024-01",
          "abstract": "The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are the locations where most of\nplanets are thought to form and where processes that influence the global\nevolution of the disk, such as MHD-winds and photoevaporation, originate.\nTransition disks (TDs) with large inner dust cavities are the ideal targets to\nstudy the inner tens of au of disks, as the central emission can be fully\ndisentangled from the outer disk emission. We present a homogeneous\nmulti-wavelength analysis of the continuum emission in a sample of 11 TDs. We\ninvestigate the nature of the central emission close to the star,\ndistinguishing between thermal dust and free-free emission. Spatially resolved\nmeasurements of continuum emission from archival ALMA data are combined with\nliterature cm-wave observations to study the spectral indices of the inner and\nouter disks separately. While the emission from the outer disks is consistent\nwith thermal dust emission, 10/11 of the spectral indices estimated for the\ncentral emission close to the star suggest that this emission is free-free\nemission, likely associated with an ionized jet or a disk wind. No correlation\nbetween the free-free luminosity and the accretion luminosity or the X-ray\nluminosity is found, arguing against the photoevaporative wind origin. A\nsub-linear correlation between the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion\nrate onto the star is observed, suggesting an origin in an ionized jet. The\nrelative lack of mm-dust grains in the majority of inner disks in transition\ndisks suggests that either such dust grains have drifted quickly towards the\ncentral star, grain growth is less efficient in the inner disk, or grains grow\nrapidly to planetesimal sizes in the inner disk. The observed correlation\nbetween the ionized mass loss rate and the accretion rate suggests the outflow\nis strictly connected with the stellar accretion and that accretion in these\ndisks is driven by a jet.",

          "abstract": "Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of\ndust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is\na plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However,\nrecent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust\ngrains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution\nmodels that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more\nstrongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously\nanticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that\nenables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly\ndrifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly\ndrifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the\ntimescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial\nadvection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for\nthe transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion\nstructure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and\nradial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations\nconfirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when\nthe predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by\nMHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal\nformation from poorly sticky grains.",

The dust component is made up of two\ndifferent components: micron-sized dust and grown dust of evolving size. For\nthe dust component, we considered the dust coagulation, fragmentation, momentum\nexchange with the gas, and dust self-gravity. We found that the micron-sized\ndust particles grow rapidly in the circumstellar disk, reaching a few cm in\nsize in the inner 100 au of the disk during less than 100 kyr after the disk\nformation, provided that fragmentation velocity is $30\\rm~ms^{-1}$. Due to the\naccretion of micron dust particles from the surrounding envelope, which serves\nas a micron dust reservoir, the approximately cm-sized dust particles continue\nto be present in the disk for more than 900 kyr after the disk formation and\nmaintain a dust-to-gas ratio close to 0.01.

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate\nturbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires\nrapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control\nVSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical\nmotion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how\nturbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the\nVSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution\nassociated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of\nthe dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of\nthe equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives\nturbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These\nsimulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution,\ncooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and\nlocal cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a\ndimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability\nof the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to\ndust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with\nthe prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi\n(2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient\ncooling can occur simultaneously.

The momentum imparted to the\nasteroid is transferred from the impacting spacecraft and enhanced by the\nmomentum of material ejected from the impact site. However, the magnitude of\nthe ejecta contribution is dependent on the material properties of the target.\nThese properties, such as strength and shear modulus, are unknown for the DART\ntarget asteroid, Dimorphos, as well as most asteroids since such properties are\ndifficult to characterize remotely.\n  This study examines how hydrocode simulations can be used to estimate\nmaterial properties from information available post-impact, specifically the\nasteroid size and shape, the velocity and properties of the impacting\nspacecraft, and the final velocity change imparted to the asteroid. Across >300\nthree-dimensional simulations varying seven material parameters describing the\nasteroid, we found many combinations of properties could reproduce a particular\nasteroid velocity. Additional observations, such as asteroid mass or crater\nsize, are required to further constrain properties like asteroid strength or\noutcomes like the momentum enhancement provided by impact ejecta.

          "abstract": "In spite of planetary resonances being a common dynamical mechanism acting on\nplanetary systems, no general model exists for describing their properties,\nparticularly for commensurabilities of any order and arbitrary values of the\neccentricities and inclinations. The present work presents a semi-analytical\nmodel that describes the resonance strength, width, location and stability of\nfixed points, as well as periods of small-amplitude librations. The model is\nvalid to any two gravitationally interacting massive bodies, and thus\napplicable to planets around single or binary stars. Using a theoretical\nframework in Poincar\\'e and Jacobi reference system we develop a\nsemi-analytical method that employs a numerical evaluation of the averaged\nresonant disturbing function. Validations of the model are presented comparing\nits predictions with dynamical maps for real and fictitious systems. The model\nis shown to describe very well many dynamical features of planetary resonances.\nNotwithstanding the good agreements found in all cases, a small deviation is\nnoted in the location of the resonance centers for circumbinary systems. As a\nconsequence of its application to the HD31527 system we have found that the\nupdated best-fit solution leads to a high-eccentricity stable libration between\nthe middle and outer planets inside the 16/3 mean-motion resonance. This is the\nfirst planetary system whose long-term dynamics appears dominated by such a\nhigh-order commensurability.

We can predict a system's resonances by\nobserving the orbital periods of the planets, as planets in or near mean motion\nresonance have period ratios that reduce to a ratio of small numbers. However,\na period ratio near commensurability does not guarantee a resonance; we must\nstudy the system's dynamics and resonant angles to confirm resonance. Because\nresonances require in-depth study to confirm, and because two-body resonances\nrequire a measurement of the eccentricity vector which is quite challenging,\nvery few resonant pairs or chains have been confirmed. We thus remain in the\nera of small number statistics, not yet able to perform large population\nsynthesis or informatics studies. To address this problem, we build a python\npackage to find, confirm, and analyze mean motion resonances, primarily through\nN-body simulations. We then analyze all near-resonant planets in the Kepler/K2\nand TESS catalogues, confirming over 60 new resonant pairs and various new\nresonant chains.

However,\nsince active regions evolve on the photosphere over time, correlations between\nthe RV observations and the activity indicators will correspondingly be\nanisotropic. We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the\ncorrelations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in\norder to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity.

We retrain and use the flatwrm2\nlong-short term memory neural network to find stellar flares in 2-min cadence\nTESS light curves from the first five years of the mission (sectors 1-69). We\nscale these flares to a comparable standard shape, and use principal component\nanalysis to describe their temporal morphology in a concise way. We investigate\nhow the flare shapes change along the main sequence, and test whether\nindividual flares hold any information about their host stars. We also apply\nsimilar techniques to solar flares, using extreme ultraviolet irradiation time\nseries. Our final catalog contains ~120,000 flares on ~14,000 stars. Due to the\nstrict filtering and the final manual vetting, this sample contains virtually\nno false positives, although at the expense of reduced completeness. Using this\nflare catalog, we detect a dependence of the average flare shape on the\nspectral type. These changes are not apparent for individual flares, only when\naveraging thousands of events. We find no strong clustering in the flare shape\nspace. We create new analytical flare templates for different types of stars,\npresent a technique to sample realistic flares, and a method to locate flares\nwith similar shapes. The flare catalog, along with the extracted flare shapes,\nand the data used to train flatwrm2 are publicly available.",

          "year": "2022-12",
          "abstract": "We present a multiwavelength study of stellar flares on primarily G-type\nstars using overlapping time domain surveys in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and\noptical regimes. The NUV (GALEX) and optical (Kepler) wavelength domains are\nimportant for understanding energy fractionations in stellar flares, and for\nconstraining the associated incident radiation on a planetary atmosphere. We\nfollow up on the NUV flare detections presented in Brasseur et al. 2019, using\ncoincident Kepler long (1557 flares) and short (2 flares) cadence light curves.\nWe find no evidence of optical flares at these times, and place limits on the\nflare energy ratio between the two wavebands. We find that the energy ratio is\ncorrelated with GALEX band energy, and extends over a range of about three\norders of magnitude in the ratio of the upper limit of Kepler band flare energy\nto NUV flare energy at the same time for each flare. The two flares with Kepler\nshort cadence data indicate that the true Kepler band energy may be much lower\nthan the long cadence based upper limit. A similar trend appears for the bulk\nflare energy properties of non-simultaneously observed flares on the same\nstars. We provide updated models to describe the flare spectral energy\ndistribution from the NUV through the optical including continua and emission\nlines to improve upon blackbody-only models. The spread of observed energy\nratios is much larger than encompassed by these models and suggests new physics\nis at work. These results call for better understanding of NUV flare physics\nand provide a cautionary tale about using only optical flare measurements to\ninfer the UV irradiation of close-in planets.",

          "year": "2022-07",
          "abstract": "We characterize the magnetic activity of M dwarfs to provide the planet\ncommunity with information on the energy input from the star; in particular, in\naddition to the frequency of optical flares directly observed with TESS, we aim\nat estimating the corresponding X-ray flare frequencies, making use of the\nsmall pool of known events observed simultaneously in both wavebands. We\nidentified 112 M dwarfs with a TESS magnitude <= 11.5 for which TESS can probe\nthe full habitable zone for transits. These 112 stars have 1276 two-minute\ncadence TESS light curves from the primary mission, which we searched for\nrotational modulation and flares. We study the link between rotation and flares\nand between flare properties, for example the flare amplitude-duration relation\nand cumulative flare energy frequency distributions (FFDs). Assuming that each\noptical flare is associated with a flare in the X-ray band, and making use of\npublished simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton flare studies, we estimate the\nX-ray energy released by our detected TESS flare events. Our calibration also\ninvolves the relation between flare energies in the TESS and K2 bands. We\ndetected more than 2500 optical flare events on a fraction of about 32% of our\ntargets and found reliable rotation periods only for 12 stars, which is a\nfraction of about 11%. For these 12 targets, we present cumulative FFDs and FFD\npower law fits. We construct FFDs in the X-ray band by calibrating optical\nflare energies to the X-rays. In the absence of directly observed X-ray FFDs\nfor main-sequence stars, our predictions can serve for estimates of the\nhigh-energy input to the planet of a typical fast-rotating early- or mid-M\ndwarf.",
