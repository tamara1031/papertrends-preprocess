Yet its practicality is getting more and more acceptance and\nrelevance, for it has proven to be an efficient and useful resource to tackle,\nexplore, describe and explain such phenomena. This practical aspect emerges\nprecisely when the pragmatic application of the formalism prevails over any\nother interpretational question, still a matter of debate and controversy. In\nthis regard, the purpose here is to show and discuss how Bohmian mechanics\nemphasizes in a natural manner a series of dynamical features difficult to find\nout through other quantum approaches. This arises from the fact that Bohmian\nmechanics allows us to establish a direct link between the dynamics exhibited\nby quantum systems and the local variations of the quantum phase associated\nwith their state. To illustrate these facts, simple models of two physically\ninsightful quantum phenomena have been chosen, namely, the dispersion of a free\nGaussian wave packet and Young-type two-slit interference. As it is shown, the\noutcomes from their analysis render a novel, alternative understanding of the\ndynamics displayed by these quantum phenomena in terms of the underlying local\nvelocity field that connects the probability density with the quantum flux.\nThis field, nothing but the so-called guidance condition in standard Bohmian\nmechanics, thus acquires a prominent role to understand quantum dynamics, as\nthe mechanism responsible for such dynamics. This goes beyond the passive role\ntypically assigned to this field in Bohmian mechanics, where traditionally\ntrajectories and quantum potentials have received more attention instead.",

          "abstract": "The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum\ntheory. To resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time is introduced in an\naccompanying paper, starting from the assumption that the treatment of time in\nphysics must agree with our cognition. The formalization has two components:\nsequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states\nis described in terms of $n$. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between\nevents in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which\n$t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between\npresent and past events. This approach leads to quantum evolution equations\nexpressed in terms of a continuous evolution parameter $\\sigma$, which\ninterpolates between discrete sequential times $n$. Rather than describing the\nevolution of the world at large, these evolution equations provide probabilites\nof a set of predefined outcomes in well-defined experimental contexts. When the\ncontext is designed to measure spatio-temporal position $(x,t)$, time $t$\nbecomes an observable with Heisenberg uncertainty $\\Delta t$ on the same\nfooting as $x$. The corresponding evolution equation attains the same symmetric\nform as that suggested by Stueckelberg in 1941. When the context is such that\nthe metric of space-time is measured, the corresponding evolution equation may\nbe seen as an expression of quantum gravity. In short, the aim of this paper is\nto propose a coherent conceptual basis for the treatment of time in evolution\nequations, in so doing clarifying their meaning and domain of validity.",

In the context of quantum gravity this is called \"the problem of time\".\nA crucial difference is that time $t$ may be seen as an observable in\nrelativity theory, just like position $x$, whereas in quantum theory $t$ is a\nparameter, in contrast to the observable $x$. Aiming to resolve the\ndiscrepancy, a formalization of time in the spirit of Kant's Copernican\nrevolution is suggested, where it is required that the treatment of time in\nphysics agree with our cognition. This leads to reconsideration of the notions\nof identity and change of objects, as well as the nature of physical states and\ntheir evolution. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and\nrelational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of\n$n$, which is updated each time an event occurs. The role of $t$ is to quantify\ndistances between events in space-time.

          "abstract": "Must a theory of quantum gravity have some truth to it if it can recover\ngeneral relativity in some limit of the theory? This paper answers this\nquestion in the negative by indicating that general relativity is multiply\nrealizable in quantum gravity. The argument is inspired by spacetime\nfunctionalism - multiple realizability being a central tenet of functionalism -\nand proceeds via three case studies: induced gravity, thermodynamic gravity,\nand entanglement gravity. In these, general relativity in the form of the\nEinstein field equations can be recovered from elements that are either\nmanifestly multiply realizable or at least of the generic nature that is\nsuggestive of functions. If general relativity, as argued here, can inherit\nthis multiple realizability, then a theory of quantum gravity can recover\ngeneral relativity while being completely wrong about the posited\nmicrostructure. As a consequence, the recovery of general relativity cannot\nserve as the ultimate arbiter that decides which theory of quantum gravity that\nis worthy of pursuit, even though it is of course not irrelevant either qua\nquantum gravity. Thus, the recovery of general relativity in string theory, for\ninstance, does not guarantee that the stringy account of the world is on the\nright track; despite sentiments to the contrary among string theorists.",

For the reconstructed eclipse events we applied the\nassumed, albeit missing, Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, which\nwas probably a part of the Mechanism gearing, representing the fourth lunar\nmotion, the Draconic cycle. The Draconic gearing is very critical for the\neclipse prediction and defines whether an eclipse will occur. For our research\nwe created a program which presents the phase of the four lunar cycles and the\nposition of the Draconic pointer relative to the ecliptic limits. After\ncalibrating the software according to the preserved eclipse events, the lost\neclipse events of the Saros spiral were calculated and discussed. The procedure\nfor the calculation of the events times by using solely the Mechanism is also\npresented. The eccentricity error of a gear which is preserved on the ancient\nprototype is discussed. An experimental setup facilitated the analysis of the\nmechanical characteristics of gears with triangular teeth and the errors. The\nexperimental study of the gears errors revealed the strong impact the\nAntikythera Mechanism pointers have on the results.",

It formed part of a three times larger vault\ndepicting the 48 Ptolemaic constellations and the rest of the planets known at\nthe time. This was a splendid work of art that covered the ceiling of the first\nlibrary of the University of Salamanca, one of the oldest in Europe having\nobtained its royal charter in 1218. But it was also a pioneering scientific\nwork: a planetarium used to teach astronomy, the first of its kind in the\nhistory of Astronomy that has come down to us in the preserved part that we now\ncall \"The Sky of Salamanca\". We describe the scientific context surrounding the\nchair of Astrology founded around 1460 at the University of Salamanca, which\nled to the production of this unique scientific work of art and to the\nflourishing of Astronomy in Salamanca. We analyse the possible dates compatible\nwith it, showing that they are extremely infrequent. In the period of 1100\nyears from 1200 to 2300 that we studied there are only 23 years that have\nfeasible days. We conclude that the information contained in \"El Cielo de\nSalamanca\" is not sufficient to assign it to a specific date but rather to an\ninterval of several days that circumstantial evidence seems to place in August\n1475. The same configuration of the sky will be observable, for the first time\nin 141 years, from the 22nd to the 25th of August 2022. The next occasion to\nobserve it live will be in 2060.",

It is argued that\nwhile rare outstanding events like solar eclipses might have caused a short\nstir in the minds of the rulers and their environment, long-term cycles based\non the synchronization of the Moon's phases with the solar calendar and the\ncycles of the planets lining up in the same disposition (in relationship to the\nMoon or without this relationship) were the foundation of astronomy-based\nChristian chronological system. The emergence of the Christian historical\nworldview in the 5th century was marked by appearance of a significant\neschatological strain in it. Historians paid attention not only to the\ntheology-defined signs of the end of the world, but also, as it has been\nsuggested in modern studies, to the some outstanding celestial phenomena. In\nthis paper I would like to address several criteria which may help understand\nwhat in the celestial motions interested the astronomers and historians of the\n5th century. This paper uses the first approximation of astronomical data for\nsolving the problem of how relevant the skies were for historians, although all\nnumeric parameters are taken from the up-to-date astronomy reference\npublications. It is an attempt to understand whether the very basic\napproximations can be related to what historians know from the array of sources\navailable to them. The analysis suggests that there is a whole array of\noccasions when the dates of astronomical events, received with the help of\nthese basic approximations, coincide with the data from historical sources.",

          "abstract": "Many scientists view science as value-free, despite the fact that both\nepistemic and non-epistemic values structure scientific inquiry. Current ethics\ntraining usually focuses on transmitting knowledge about high-level ethical\nconcepts or rules and is widely regarded as ineffective. We argue that ethics\ntraining will be more effective at improving ethical decision making if it\nfocuses on connecting values to science. We pull from philosophy and psychology\nto define ethical decision making using the Four Component Model. This model\nstates that in order to make an ethical decision someone must consider four\ncomponents: moral sensitivity, moral reasoning, moral motivation, and moral\nimplementation. We formed a moderated fellowship of fourteen science faculty\nfrom different disciplines who met for ten sessions over the course of a year,\nwhere they discussed the values embedded in different scientific norms. We then\nconducted interviews before and after the year-long fellowship that involved\nguided reflection of scenarios where there was some kind of ethical misconduct\nwhere the scientific practice required value judgements (e.g using unpublished\ndata in their own work). We looked at how the fellowship affected the\nscientists' ability to recognize ethical dimensions regarding the scenarios. We\nfound that this fellowship improved moral sensitivity, but their moral\nreasoning does not improve. We outlined our approach on how to look at\nscientists' ethical decision making and made recommendations on how to improve\nour approach. This work can inform future ethical training to align better with\nwhat scientists value and introduce useful concepts from philosophy and\npsychology to education research in physics.",

          "abstract": "Scientific understanding is a fundamental goal of science, allowing us to\nexplain the world. There is currently no good way to measure the scientific\nunderstanding of agents, whether these be humans or Artificial Intelligence\nsystems. Without a clear benchmark, it is challenging to evaluate and compare\ndifferent levels of and approaches to scientific understanding. In this\nRoadmap, we propose a framework to create a benchmark for scientific\nunderstanding, utilizing tools from philosophy of science. We adopt a\nbehavioral notion according to which genuine understanding should be recognized\nas an ability to perform certain tasks. We extend this notion by considering a\nset of questions that can gauge different levels of scientific understanding,\ncovering information retrieval, the capability to arrange information to\nproduce an explanation, and the ability to infer how things would be different\nunder different circumstances. The Scientific Understanding Benchmark (SUB),\nwhich is formed by a set of these tests, allows for the evaluation and\ncomparison of different approaches. Benchmarking plays a crucial role in\nestablishing trust, ensuring quality control, and providing a basis for\nperformance evaluation. By aligning machine and human scientific understanding\nwe can improve their utility, ultimately advancing scientific understanding and\nhelping to discover new insights within machines.",

          "abstract": "Though neural networks trained on large datasets have been successfully used\nto describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among\nscientists that, unlike traditional scientific models comprising simple\nmathematical expressions, their findings cannot be integrated into the body of\nscientific knowledge. Critics of machine learning's inability to produce\nhuman-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of\n\"interpretability\" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of\nscience. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in\nthe physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the\nfundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity\naround a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in\nscience is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers\nin equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of\nsparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable machine\nlearning from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the\ndefinitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability\nfor scientific machine learning (SciML), they are inadequate for this new\npurpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of\ninterpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability\nemphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous\nthough it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often\nunnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific\ndiscovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and\nphilosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help\nfocus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a\ndata-driven scientific future.",

Thus\nBrillouin, who identified measurement as savior of the second law, was\nessentially correct, and putative refutations of his view, such as Bennett's\nclaim to measure without entropy cost, are seen to fail when the applicable\nphysics is taken into account. I argue that the tradition of attributing the\ndefeat of Maxwell's Demon to erasure rather than to measurement arose from\nunphysical classical idealizations that do not hold for real gas molecules, as\nwell as a physically ungrounded recasting of physical thermodynamical processes\ninto computational and information-theoretic conceptualizations.

I obtain the specific entropy cost for localizing a molecule in the\nSzilard engine and show that it coincides with the quantity attributed to\nLandauer's principle.

The present article takes\nan integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify\nthe reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter\nhypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A\nplausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the\npursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its\ncompatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation,\nand (c) its independent testability.

          "abstract": "The scientific status of physical cosmology has been the subject of\nphilosophical debate ever since detailed mathematical models of the Universe\nemerged from Einstein's general theory of relativity. Such debates have\nrevolved around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established\ndemarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining\nhow to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges\nand limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin,\ncomposition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in\nlight of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier\ndebate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the\nscientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an\nemerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical\nsuccesses in establishing the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model\nand in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this\nremarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology\nfaces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the\nmicrophysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter,\nand dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in\nrevealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the\nepistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of\nthese exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon\nwhether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges.
