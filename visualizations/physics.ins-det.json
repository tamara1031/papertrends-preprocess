Neither phase discrimination nor\nactive phase tracking is required due to the open-loop design, mitigating some\ntechnical problems, such as the limited compensation speed and the finite\nphase/timing jitter, in conventional phase noise cancellation. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that this technique maintains the same delay-limited\nbandwidth and phase noise suppression capability as in conventional techniques,\nbut significantly shortens the response speed and phase recovery time. Passive\ndecoupling optical phase perturbation represents a powerful technique in the\ndomains of optical frequency standard comparisons and clockworks for future\noptical atomic clocks, which are now under serious investigation for a\npotential redefinition of the International Time Scale.",

          "abstract": "A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are\nparasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which\ncan cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser\ninterferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their\nsensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the\ninfluence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances\ninto phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By\nartificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise\n(PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed.\nAs it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice\nthe coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility\nof this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB\nin a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm.\nWe probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the\nPRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the\npresence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with\nand without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and\nthe PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.",

Conventional modeling of these noises assumes a linear response\nof the optical field to the fluctuations of cavity frequency. Fundamentally,\nhowever, this response is nonlinear. Here we show that nonlinearly transduced\nthermal fluctuations of cavity frequency can dominate the broadband noise in\nphotodetection, even when the magnitude of fluctuations is much smaller than\nthe cavity linewidth. We term this noise \"thermal intermodulation noise\" and\nshow that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We\nreport and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical\ncavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian\nmotion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We\ndemonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics:\nusing a phononic crystal $Si_3N_4$ membrane with a low mass, soft-clamped\nmechanical mode we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum\nbackaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does.\nHowever, in the presence of intermodulation noise, quantum signatures of\nmeasurement are not revealed in direct photodetectors. The reported noise\nmechanism, while studied for an optomechanical system, can exist in any optical\ncavity.",

          "abstract": "The reconstruction of particle trajectories is a key challenge of particle\nphysics experiments, as it directly impacts particle identification and physics\nperformances while also representing one of the main CPU consumers of many\nhigh-energy physics experiments. As the luminosity of particle colliders\nincreases, this reconstruction will become more challenging and\nresource-intensive. New algorithms are thus needed to address these challenges\nefficiently. One potential step of track reconstruction is ambiguity\nresolution. In this step, performed at the end of the tracking chain, we select\nwhich tracks candidates should be kept and which must be discarded. The speed\nof this algorithm is directly driven by the number of track candidates, which\ncan be reduced at the cost of some physics performance. Since this problem is\nfundamentally an issue of comparison and classification, we propose to use a\nmachine learning-based approach to the Ambiguity Resolution. Using a\nshared-hits-based clustering algorithm, we can efficiently determine which\ncandidates belong to the same truth particle. Afterwards, we can apply a Neural\nNetwork (NN) to compare those tracks and decide which ones are duplicates and\nwhich ones should be kept. This approach is implemented within A Common\nTracking Software (ACTS) framework and tested on the Open Data Detector (ODD),\na realistic virtual detector similar to a future ATLAS one. This new approach\nwas shown to be 15 times faster than the default ACTS algorithm while removing\n32 times more duplicates down to less than one duplicated track per event.",

          "abstract": "Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage which causes\nan increase of dark count rate. This leads to an increase in low-energy\nthreshold in a gamma-ray detector combining SiPM and a scintillator. Despite\nthis drawback, they are becoming preferred for scintillator-based gamma-ray\ndetectors on CubeSats due to their low operation voltage, small size, linear\nresponse to low light intensity and fast response. This increasing popularity\nof SiPMs among new spaceborne missions makes it important to characterize their\nlong-term performance in the space environment. In this work, we report the\nchange of the dark count rate and low-energy threshold of S13360-3050 PE\nmulti-pixel photon counters (MPPCs) by Hamamatsu, using measurements acquired\nby the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over\nthree years. Such a long measurement of the performance of MPPCs in space has\nnot been published before. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021,\nto a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a\ngamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and\nregularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar\nflares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched\non January 13, 2022 also to a 535 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among\nother payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have\nflight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs,\nshielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in LEO environment on a\nscientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of\nMPPCs being employed in future satellites.",

After the exposure, the bias map, readout noise\nand conversion gain at various temperatures are not significantly degraded, nor\nis the energy resolution at -30 degree. However, after the exposure the dark\ncurrent has increased by hundreds of times, and for every 20 degree increase in\ntemperature, the dark current also increases by an order of magnitude.\nTherefore, at room temperature, the fluctuations of the dark currents dominate\nthe noise and lead to a serious degradation of the energy resolution.

In contrast,\nfast-neutrons are much more penetrating and can escape relatively thick high-Z\nshielding without losing significant energy. Furthermore, fast neutrons provide\na clear and unambiguous signature of the presence of SNM with few competing\nnatural background sources. The challenge of detecting fast neutrons is\ntwofold. First, the neutron flux from SNM are only a fraction of the\ncorresponding gamma-ray flux. Second, fast neutrons can be difficult to\ndifferentiate from gamma rays. The ability to discriminate gamma rays from\nneutrons combined with neutron imaging can yield large benefit to isolate the\nlocalized SNM neutron source from background. With the recent developments of\npulse-shape-sensitive plastic scintillators that offer excellent\ngamma-ray/neutron discrimination, and arrays of silicon photomultipliers\ncombined with highly scalable and fast positron-emission-tomography (PET)\nmulti-channel readout systems, field-deployable neutron imagers suitable for\nSNM detection might now be within reach. In this paper, we present a\ncharacterization of the performance of a recently available commercial\nPET-scanner readout, including its sensitivity to pulse-shape differences\nbetween fast neutrons and gamma rays, energy and timing resolution, as well as\nlinearity and dynamic range. We find that, while the pulse-shape discrimination\nis achievable with stilbene, further improvement of the readout is required to\nachieve it with the best available plastic scintillators.

Our developments to cope with these three aspects are\nconcomitant with those required in the field of hadron therapy, especially in\nterms of high efficiency for real-time monitoring, low sensitivity to neutron\nbackgrounds and reliable performance at the high $\\gamma$-ray energies. We find\nthat signal-to-background ratios can be appreciably improved with i-TED thanks\nto its light-weight design and the low neutron-capture cross sections of its\nLaCl$_{3}$ crystals, when compared to other similar systems based on LYSO,\nCdZnTe or LaBr$_{3}$. Its high time-resolution (CRT$\\sim$500 ps) represents an\nadditional advantage for background suppression when operated in pulsed HT\nmode. Each i-TED module features two detection planes of very large LaCl$_{3}$\nmonolithic crystals, thereby achieving a high efficiency in coincidence of 0.2%\nfor a point-like 1MeV $\\gamma$-ray source at 5 cm distance.

          "abstract": "In both particle physics and muon applications, a high-resolution muon\nmomentum measurement capability plays a significant role not only in providing\nvaluable information on the properties of subatomic particles but also in\nimproving the utilizability of cosmic ray muons. Typically, muon momentum is\nmeasured by reconstructing a curved muon path using a strong magnetic field and\nmuon trackers. Alternatively, a time-of-flight and Cherenkov ring imager are\nless frequently applied, especially when there is a need to avoid a magnetic\nfield. However, measurement resolution is much less than that of magnetic\nspectrometers, approximately 20% whereas it is nearly 4% or less when using\nmagnets and trackers. Here, we propose a different paradigm to estimate muon\nmomentum that utilizes multiple pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators. Using the\nfact that the refractive index of gas medium varies depending on its pressure\nand temperature, we can optimize the muon Cherenkov threshold momentum levels\nfor which a muon signal will be detected. In this work, we demonstrate that\nmuon momentum can be estimated with mean resolution of {sigma_p}/p < 20% and\nmean classification rate of 90.08% in the momentum range of 0.1 to 10.0 GeV/c\nby analyzing optical photon signals from each Cherenkov radiator.

          "abstract": "Cosmic ray muons present a large part of the radiation background and\ndepending on the application of interest muons can be seen as background noise,\ne.g., radiation mapping, radiation protection, dosimetry, or as a useful\ninterrogation probe such as cosmic ray muon tomography. It is worth noting\nrecent developments on muon scattering tomography which has emerged as a\nprospective noninvasive monitoring method for many applications including spent\nnuclear fuel cask monitoring and geotomography. However, it is still very\nchallenging to measure muon momentum in the field, despite the apparent\nbenefits, without resorting to large and expensive calorimeters, ring imagers,\nor time of flight detectors. Recent efforts at CNL and INFN have developed\nlarge prototypes based on multiple Coulomb scattering coupled with the muon\nmomentum reconstruction algorithms. While these efforts show promise, no\nportable detectors exist that can measure muon momentum in the field. In this\nwork, we present a new concept for measuring muon momentum using coupled\npressurized gaseous Cherenkov radiators. By carefully selecting the gas\npressure at each radiator we can optimize the muon momentum threshold for which\na muon signal will be detected. This way, a muon passing through the radiators\nwill only trigger those radiators with momentum threshold less than the actual\nmuon momentum. By measuring the presence of Cherenkov signals in each radiator,\nour system can then estimate the muon momentum. The primary benefit of such a\nconcept is that it can be compact and portable enough so that it can be\ndeployed in the field separately or in combination with existing tomography\nsystems.",

Knowledge\nof cosmic ray muon momentum has the potential to significantly improve and\nexpand the use of a variety of recently developed muon-based radiographic\ntechniques. However, existing muon tomography systems rely only on muon\ntracking and have no momentum measurement capabilities which reduces the image\nresolution and requires longer measurement times. A fieldable cosmic ray muon\nspectrometer with momentum measurement capabilities for use in muon scattering\ntomography is currently missing. We address this challenge by optimally varying\nthe pressure of multiple gaseous Cherenkov radiators and identifying the\nradiators that are triggered by muons that have momentum higher than the\nCherenkov threshold momentum. We evaluate the proposed concept through Geant4\nsimulations and demonstrate that the cosmic ray muon momentum spectrum can be\nreconstructed with sufficient accuracy and resolution for two scenarios: (i) a\nperfect Cherenkov muon spectrometer and (ii) a practical spectrometer where\nnoise is introduced in the form of scintillation and transition radiation\nphotons. To quantify the accuracy of spectrometer, the concept of true and\nfalse classifications are introduced. The fraction of true classification is\ninvestigated for each momentum level in a practical radiator.

This converts the electron signal into a\nlight signal, and yields a high electron detection efficiency with a gain of\ntens of photoelectrons (PE) per electron. This technique of detecting both\nscintillation and ionization gives dual phase xenon TPCs the capability to\ndistinguish between electronic and nuclear recoils, which is a key part of how\nthese detectors are able to reach world-leading limits on Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particle (WIMP) dark matter.

Firstly,\nit presents the data acquisition and processing protocol developed to establish\na selection criteria for events compatible with the dark matter signal. This\nprotocol also enabled the structure and tools used for the study and\ncharacterization of phenomena that impact the quality of measurements made in\nthe search for dark matter (measurement of the Fano factor, determination of\nthe Compton background, and characterization of the high-energy surface\nbackground), which were carried out during this work. Secondly, it discusses\nthe comprehensive study conducted on the origin of single-electron events in\nSkipper-CCDs, which allowed for the selection of detector operating parameters\nand improved the detection sensitivity in the search for dark matter. It is\nhighlighted the characterization of the spatial correlation between\nsingle-electron events and high-energy events, among other developed event\nselection criteria, and the optimization of the output device to reduce sources\nof luminescence during its operation. As a result of this study, the lowest\nlevels of dark current and spurious charge ever measured in a CCD are reported.\nFinally, the latest published results from SENSEI are presented. The obtained\nlimits for the scattering of a light mediator are the best reported to date\nacross the entire investigated mass range, while for the heavy mediator, they\nare the best for masses below 10 MeV. In terms of dark matter absorption, the\nmost restringent limits below 10 eV are reported. These results, achieved with\nonly a very small fraction of the total projected exposure for SENSEI, position\nSkipper-CCDs as leaders in the search for light dark matter worldwide.",

          "abstract": "We propose a method to increase both the neutron storage time and the\nprecision of its lifetime measurements by at least tenfold. The storage of\nultracold neutrons (UCN) in material traps now provides the most accurate\nmeasurements of neutron lifetime and is used in many other experiments. The\nprecision of these measurements is limited by the interaction of UCN with the\ntrap walls. We show that covering trap walls with liquid helium may strongly\ndecrease the UCN losses from material traps. $^4$He does not absorb neutrons at\nall. Superfluid He covers the trap walls as a thin film, $\\sim 10$ nm thick,\ndue to the van der Waals attraction. However, this He film on a flat wall is\ntoo thin to protect the UCN from their absorption inside a trap material. By\ncombining the van der Waals attraction with capillary effects we show that\nsurface roughness may increase the thickness of this film much beyond the\nneutron penetration depth $\\sim 33$nm. Using liquid He for UCN storage requires\nlow temperature $T<0.5$ K to avoid neutron interaction with He vapor, while the\nneutron losses because of the interaction with surface waves are small and can\nbe accounted for using their linear temperature dependence.",

As part of the TRIUMF\nUltracold Advanced Neutron (TUCAN) collaboration, we are developing spin\nanalyzers for ultracold neutrons (UCNs) to be used for a next-generation\nexperiment to measure the neutron EDM with unprecedented precision. Spin-state\nanalysis of UCNs constitutes an essential part of the neutron EDM measurement\nsequence. Magnetized iron films used as spin filters of UCNs are crucial\nexperimental components, whose performance directly influences the statistical\nsensitivity of the measurement. To test such iron film spin filters, we propose\nthe use of polarized cold-neutron reflectometry, in addition to conventional\nUCN transmission experiments. The new method provides information on iron film\nsamples complementary to the UCN tests and accelerates the development cycles.\nWe developed a collaborative effort to produce iron film spin filters and test\nthem with cold and ultracold neutrons available at JRR-3/MINE2 and J-PARC/MLF\nBL05.

Several subsystems have been improved,\nincluding the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS), which has been entirely\nreplaced. The new pixel-only tracker (ITS2) consists of 7 layers of Monolithic\nActive Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of 27x29 $\\mu$m$^2$, with an\nintrinsic spatial resolution of 5 $\\mu$m. With 24120 sensors and 12.5 billion\npixels, this detector covers an active area of about 10 m$^2$ and represents\nthe largest application of the MAPS technology in a high-energy physics\nexperiment to date. The most significant improvements introduced by the ITS2 to\nthe ALICE experiment include a reduction in the impact parameter resolution to\napproximately 30 $\\mu$m in both the r$\\varphi$ and z coordinates at a\ntransverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. This is a factor of 3 improvement over the\nprevious detector. Additionally, the standard ITS readout rate has been\nincreased from 1 kHz to 67 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions and to 202 kHz in\nproton-proton collisions. To ensure stable operations and maintain high data\nquality a regular calibration is performed, which consists in establishing the\ncharge threshold and the noisy channels of the detector. The ITS2 has been\nsuccessfully commissioned for LHC Run3, and already operated during\nproton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC with excellent performance. This\ncontribution gives an overview of the operational procedures required to\nmaintain an optimal data quality, along with results obtained from calibration\nand the performance achieved during the LHC Run 3.",
