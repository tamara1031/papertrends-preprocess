At high activity values, the particles,\ninteracting via purely repulsive and short-ranged forces, aggregate into\nseveral motile and dynamical clusters of comparable size, and do not display\nbulk phase-segregation. In this dynamical steady-state, we find that the\ncluster size distribution of these aggregates is a scaled function of the\ndensity and activity parameters across the three models of active particles\nwith the same scaling function. The velocity distribution of these motile\nclusters is non-Gaussian. We show that the effective dynamics of these clusters\ncan explain the observed emergent scaling of the mean-squared displacement of\ntagged particles for all the three models with identical scaling exponents and\nfunctions. Concomitant with the clustering seen at high activities, we observe\nthat the static density correlation function displays rich structures,\nincluding multiple peaks that are reminiscent of particle clustering induced by\neffective attractive interactions, while the dynamical variant shows\nnon-diffusive scaling. Our study reveals a universal scaling behavior in the\nsingle-file dynamics of interacting active particles.",

We employ a variant of the diffusing\ndiffusivity model where the equation of motion of the active particle involves\na time-dependent motility and diffusivities. Within our model, those\nfluctuations are coupled to each other. Using analytical methods, we obtain the\nprobability distribution function of particle displacement and its moments for\na single particle. We then investigate the impact of the environmental\nfluctuations on the collective behavior of the active Brownian particles by\nmeans of extensive numerical simulations. Our results show that the\nfluctuations hinder the motility-induced phase separation, accompanied by a\nsignificant change of the density dependence of particle velocities.

Usually, for modeling the motion of active particles, the\nself-propulsion speed is assumed to be constant as in the famous model of\nactive Brownian motion. This assumption is far from what may happen in reality.\nHere, we generalize active Brownian motion by considering stochastic\nself-propulsion speed $v(t)$. In particular, we assume that $v(t)$ is a\ntwo-state process with $v=0$ (passive state) and $v=s$ (active state). The\ntransition between the two states is also modeled using the random telegraph\nprocess. It is expected that the presented two-state model where we call it\nactive-passive Brownian particle has the characteristics of both pure active-\nand pure passive-Brownian particle. The analytical results for the first two\nmoments of displacement and the effective diffusion coefficient confirm this\nexpectation. We also show that a run-and-tumble particle (such as a motile\nbacterium) can be mapped to our model so that their diffusivities at large\nscales are equal.",

          "abstract": "Solvation of ions is ubiquitous on our planet. Solvated ions have a profound\neffect on the behavior of ionic solutions, which is crucial in nature and\ntechnology. Experimentally, ions have been classified into \"structure makers\"\nor \"structure breakers\", depending on whether they slow down or accelerate the\nsolution dynamics. Theoretically, the dynamics of ions has been explained by a\ndielectric friction model combining hydrodynamics and charge-dipole interaction\nin the continuum description. However, both approaches lack a microscopic\nstructural basis, leaving the microscopic understanding of salt effects\nunclear. Here we elucidate unique microscopic features of solvation of\nspherical ions by computer simulations. We find that increasing the ion\nelectric field causes a sharp transitional decrease in the hydration-shell\nthickness, signaling the ion mobility change from the Stokes to dielectric\nfriction regime. The dielectric friction regime can be further divided into two\ndue to the competition between the water-water hydrogen bonding and ion-water\nelectrostatic interactions: Whether the former or latter prevails determines\nwhether the water dynamics are accelerated or decelerated. In the ion-water\ninteraction predominant regime, a specific combination of ion size and charge\nstabilizes the hydration shell via orientational-symmetry breaking, reminiscent\nof the Thomson problem for the electron configuration of atoms. Notably, the\nhydration-shell stability is much higher for a composite coordination number\nthan a prime one, a prime-number effect on solvent dynamics. These findings are\nfundamental to the structure breaker/maker concept and provide new insights\ninto the solvent structure and dynamics beyond the continuum model, paving the\nway towards a microscopic theory of ionic solutions.",

Secondly, width of the range of voltage in\nwhich the properties at the charged surface symmetrically vary decreases with\nincreasing bulk salt concentration. In addition, we show that the excluded\nvolume effect of water molecules and the orientational ordering of water\ndipoles can lead to early onset and lowering of the maximum of electric\ncapacitance according to surface voltage.

          "abstract": "We study the spreading dynamics of a sphere-shaped elastic non-Newtonian\nliquid drop on a spherical substrate in the capillary driven regime. We use the\nsimplified Phan Thien Tanner model to represent the rheology of the elastic\nnon-Newtonian drop. We consider the drop to be a crater on a flat substrate to\ncalculate the viscous dissipation near the contact line. Following the approach\ncompatible with the capillary-viscous force balance, we establish the evolution\nequation for describing the temporal evolution of the contact line during\nspreading. We show that the contact line velocity obtained from the theoretical\ncalculation matches well with our experimental observations. Also, as confirmed\nby the present experimental observations, our analysis deems efficient to\ncapture the phenomenon during the late-stage of spreading for which the effect\nof line tension becomes dominant. An increment in the viscoelastic parameter of\nthe fluid increases the viscous dissipation effect at the contact line. It is\nseen that the higher dissipation effect leads to an enhancement in the wetting\ntime of the drop on the spherical substrate. Also, we have shown that the\nelastic nature of fluid leads to an increment in the dynamic contact angle at\nany temporal instant as compared to its Newtonian counterpart. Finally, we\nunveil that the phenomenon of increasing contact angle results in the time\nrequired for the complete wetting of drop becomes higher with increasing\nviscoelasticity of the fluid.

For other liquid/substrate pairs, the observed\ncontact-line motion suggests that a maximum static friction force is important\nin addition to damping.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical\nimplementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation\nand propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic\nloading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To\nthis end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large\nbody of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and\npropagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively,\nthe experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any\nattempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to\naccount for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and\niii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all\nthese three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by\nKumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551)\nfor elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy\ndissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a\nhypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for\nelastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition\nfor materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but\nalso by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and\nLopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point\nof view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value\nproblem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the\ndeformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust\nscheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel one-dimensional (1D) discrete differential\ngeometry (DDG)-based numerical method for geometrically nonlinear mechanics\nanalysis (e.g., buckling and snapping) of axisymmetric shell structures. Our\nnumerical model leverages differential geometry principles to accurately\ncapture the complex nonlinear deformation patterns exhibited by axisymmetric\nshells. By discretizing the axisymmetric shell into interconnected 1D elements\nalong the meridional direction, the in-plane stretching and out-of-bending\npotentials are formulated based on the geometric principles of 1D nodes and\nedges under the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, and elastic force vector and\nassociated Hession matrix required by equations of motion are later derived\nbased on symbolic calculation. Through extensive validation with available\ntheoretical solutions and finite element method (FEM) simulations in\nliterature, our model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting the nonlinear\nbehavior of axisymmetric shells. Importantly, compared to the classical\ntheoretical model and three-dimensional (3D) FEM simulation, our model is\nhighly computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale real-time\nsimulations of nonlinear problems of shell structures such as instability and\nsnap-through phenomena. Moreover, our framework can easily incorporate complex\nloading conditions, e.g., boundary nonlinear contact and multi-physics\nactuation, which play an essential role in the use of engineering applications,\nsuch as soft robots and flexible devices. This study demonstrates that the\nsimplicity and effectiveness of the 1D discrete differential geometry-based\napproach render it a powerful tool for engineers and researchers interested in\nnonlinear mechanics analysis of axisymmetric shells, with potential\napplications in various engineering fields.",

This paper describes a two-dimensional cell\nmembrane model that represents cells on a substrate with polygons and expresses\nvarious mechanical forces on the cell surface, keeping these forces balanced at\nall times by neglecting cell inertia. The model is discrete but equivalent to a\ncontinuous model if appropriate replacement rules for cell surface segments are\nchosen. When cells are given a polarity, expressed by a direction-dependent\nsurface tension reflecting the location dependence of contraction and adhesion\non a cell boundary, the cell surface begins to flow from front to rear as a\nresult of force balance. This flow produces unidirectional cell movement, not\nonly for a single cell but also for multiple cells in a cluster, with migration\nspeeds that coincide with analytical results from a continuous model. Further,\nif the direction of cell polarity is tilted with respect to the cluster center,\nsurface flow induces cell cluster rotation.

This research gives first detailed insights\ninto the influence of DMA on the swelling of PNIPAM microgels and the\ncorrelation with their nanomechanical properties. Dynamic light scattering\n(DLS) was used to analyse the swelling behaviour of microgels in bulk solution.\nThe incorporation of DMA decreases the volume phase transition temperature\n(VPTT) and completion temperature (VPT CT) due to its higher hydrophobicity\nwhen compared to NIPAM, while sharpening the transition. The cross-linking\nability of DMA decreases swelling ratios and mesh sizes of the microgels.\nMicrogels adsorbed at the solid surface are characterised by atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM): Scanning provides information about the microgel's shape on\nthe surface and force spectroscopy measurements determines their nanomechanical\nproperties ($E$ modulus). As the DMA content increases, microgels protrude more\nfrom the surface, correlating with an increase of $E$ modulus and a stiffening\nof the microgels - confirming the cross-linking ability of DMA. Force\nspectroscopy measurements below and above the VPTT display a stiffening of the\nmicrogels with the incorporation of DMA and upon heating across it's entire\ncross-section. The affine network factor $\\beta$, derived from the Flory-Rehner\ntheory describing the elasticity and swelling of the microgel network, is\nlinearly correlated with the $E$ moduli of the microgels for both - pure PNIPAM\nand P(NIPAM-co-DMA) microgels. However, for large amounts of DMA, DMA appears\nto hinder the microgel shrinking, while still ensuring mechanical stiffness,\npossibly due to catechol interactions within the microgel network.",

In this work, we combine compression isotherms, atomic force\nmicroscopy imaging, and computer simulations to further investigate the\nbehavior of pH-responsive microgels at oil-water interfaces. At low\ncompression, charged microgels can be compressed more than uncharged microgels.\nThe in-plane effective area of charged microgels is found to be smaller in\ncomparison to uncharged ones. Thus, the compressibility is governed by in-plane\ninteractions of the microgels with the interface. At high compression, however,\ncharged microgels are less compressible than uncharged microgels. Microgel\nfractions located in the aqueous phase interact earlier for charged than for\nuncharged microgels because of their different swelling perpendicular to the\ninterface. Therefore, the compressibility at high compression is controlled by\nout-of-plane interactions. In addition, the size of the investigated microgels\nplays a pivotal role. The charge-dependent difference in compressibility at low\ncompression is only observed for small but not for large microgels, while the\nbehavior at high compression does not depend on the size.

The differences in $\\alpha$ between MRJ packings\nand recently proposed Manna-class random close packed (RCP) states, which were\nreported to have $\\alpha = 0.25$ in $d=3$ and be nonhyperuniform ($\\alpha = 0$)\nfor $d = 4$ and $d = 5$, demonstrate the vivid distinctions between the\nlarge-scale structure of RCP and MRJ states in these dimensions. Our work\nclarifies the importance of the link between true jamming and hyperuniformity\nand motivates the development of an algorithm to produce rattler-free\nthree-dimensional MRJ packings.",

          "abstract": "Jammed (mechanically rigid) polydisperse circular-disk packings in two\ndimensions (2D) are popular models for structural glass formers. Maximally\nrandom jammed (MRJ) states, which are the most disordered packings subject to\nstrict jamming, have been shown to be hyperuniform. The characterization of the\nhyperuniformity of MRJ circular-disk packings has covered only a very small\npart of the possible parameter space for the disk-size distributions.\nHyperuniform heterogeneous media are those that anomalously suppress\nlarge-scale volume-fraction fluctuations compared to those in typical\ndisordered systems, i.e., their spectral densities\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_{_V}(\\mathbf{k})$ tend to 0 as the wavenumber\n$k\\equiv|\\mathbf{k}|$ tends to 0 and are described by the power-law\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_{_V}(\\mathbf{k})\\sim k^{\\alpha}$ as $k\\rightarrow0$ where\n$\\alpha$ is the hyperuniformity scaling exponent. In this work, we generate and\ncharacterize the structure of strictly jammed binary circular-disk packings\nwith disk-size ratio $\\beta$ and a molar ratio of 1:1. By characterizing the\nrattler fraction, the fraction of isostatic configurations in an ensemble with\nfixed $\\beta$, and the $n$-fold orientational order metrics of ensembles of\npackings with a wide range of $\\beta$, we show that size ratios $1.2\\lesssim\n\\beta\\lesssim 2.0$ produce MRJ-like states, which we show are the most\ndisordered packings according to several criteria. Using the large-length-scale\nscaling of the volume fraction variance, we extract $\\alpha$ from these\npackings, and find the function $\\alpha(\\beta)$ is maximized at $\\beta$ = 1.4\n(with $\\alpha = 0.450\\pm0.002$) within the range $1.2\\leq\\beta\\leq2.0$, and\ndecreases rapidly outside of this range. The results from this work can inform\nthe experimental design of disordered hyperuniform thin-film materials with\ntunable degrees of orientational and translational disorder. (abridged)",
