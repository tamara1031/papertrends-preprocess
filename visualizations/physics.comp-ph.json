          "abstract": "This article aims at developing a high order pressure-based solver for the\nsolution of the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes system at all Mach numbers. We\npropose a cell-centered discretization of the governing equations that splits\nthe fluxes into a fast and a slow scale part, that are treated implicitly and\nexplicitly, respectively. A novel semi-implicit discretization is proposed for\nthe kinetic energy as well as the enthalpy fluxes in the energy equation, hence\navoiding any need of iterative solvers. The implicit discretization yields an\nelliptic equation on the pressure that can be solved for both ideal gas and\ngeneral equation of state (EOS). A nested Newton method is used to solve the\nmildly nonlinear system for the pressure in case of nonlinear EOS. High order\nin time is granted by implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping, whereas a novel\nCWENO technique efficiently implemented in a dimension-by-dimension manner is\ndeveloped for achieving high order in space for the discretization of explicit\nconvective and viscous fluxes. A quadrature-free finite volume solver is then\nderived for the high order approximation of numerical fluxes. Central schemes\nwith no dissipation of suitable order of accuracy are finally employed for the\nnumerical approximation of the implicit terms. Consequently, the CFL-type\nstability condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the\nfluid velocity and not on the sound speed, so that the novel schemes work\nuniformly for all Mach numbers. Convergence and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are assessed through a wide set of benchmark problems involving low and\nhigh Mach number regimes, as well as inviscid and viscous flows.",

In order to develop a multiscale method for the\nrarefied and continuum flow simulation, by adopting the integral solution of\nthe kinetic model equation a DVM-type unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) has\nbeen constructed. The UGKS models the gas dynamics on the cell size and time\nstep scales while the accumulating effect from particle transport and collision\nhas been taken into account within a time step. Under the UGKS framework, a\nunified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method has been further developed for\nnon-equilibrium flow simulation, where the time evolution of gas distribution\nfunction is composed of analytical wave and individual particle. In the highly\nrarefied regime, particle transport and collision will play a dominant role.\nDue to the single relaxation time model for particle collision, there is a\nnoticeable discrepancy between the UGKWP solution and the full Boltzmann or\nDSMC result, especially in the high Mach and Knudsen number cases. In this\npaper, besides the kinetic relaxation model, a modification of particle\ncollision time according to the particle velocity will be implemented in UGKWP.\nAs a result, the new model greatly improves the performance of UGKWP in the\ncapturing of non-equilibrium flow.

The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are\nwell-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and\ntype of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.\nIn this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic\nchiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic\ndisilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin\nzones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of\nchemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with\nthe efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that\nmagnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial\n(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,\n(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic\ndirection, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the\nsame crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that\nlarger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields\ngreater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,\nwhich prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized\nbands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We\nbelieve that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and\nmay aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials\nwith different symmetries and SOC strengths.",

In the present study, the structural, electronic, and phase\nstability of 2D layered ZnSb compounds of four different phases viz.\nwurzite(w), tetragonal (t), hexagonal (h), and orthorhombic (o) have been tuned\nusing the first principle calculations based on density functional theory\n(DFT). We invoked the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the projected\naugmented wave (PAW) method during all the calculations. Based on our numerical\nresults, we predicted the novel tetragonal phase as stable phase of ZnSb next\nto existing orthorhombic structure. We reported the pressure induced phase\ntransition between orthorhombic to tetragonal phase at 12.48 GPa/atom. The\nprojected density of states indicates the strong p-d hybridization between\nSb-5p and Zn-3d states confirming the nature of strong covalent bonding between\nthem. The electronic band structures suggest that t-ZnSb, w-ZnSb, and h-ZnSb\nare metallic in nature whereas o-ZnSb is semiconducting with narrow band gap of\n0.03 eV using PBE. We predicted the possibility of extracting the two\ndimensional (2D) monolayer sheet in t-ZnSb and o-ZnSb according to the\nexfoliation energy criterion. In addition, the 2D monolayer (ML) of o-ZnSb has\nbeen predicted to be dynamically stable but that of t-ZnSb is not stable as\nmanifested in phonon dispersion bands. Surprisingly, the semiconducting band\ngap nature of o-ZnSb changes from indirect and narrow to direct and sizable\nwhile going from 3D bulk to 2D ML structure. Further, we estimated the value of\nwork functions for the surfaces of t-ZnSb and o-ZnSb as 4.61 eV and 4.04 eV\nrespectively.

We find\nthat, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the\nactive monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic\nproperties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it,\nstraightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as\nactivity-induced stiffening.
