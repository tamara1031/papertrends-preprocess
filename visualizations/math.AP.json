          "abstract": "This paper investigates the global existence of classical solutions to the\nisentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary condition in\na three-dimensional (3D) exterior domain. It is shown that the classical\nsolutions with large initial energy and vacuum exist globally in time when the\nadiabatic exponent $\\gamma>1$ is sufficiently close to 1 (near-isothermal\nregime). This constitutes an extension of the celebrated result for the\none-dimensional Cauchy problem of the isentropic Euler equations that has been\nestablished in 1973 by Nishida and Smoller (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 26 (1973),\n183-200). To the best of our knowledge, we establish the first result on the\nglobal existence of large-energy solutions with vacuum to the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with slip boundary condition in a 3D exterior domain,\nwhich improves previous related works where either small initial energy is\nrequired or boundary effects are ignored.",

          "year": "2022-04",
          "abstract": "We are concerned with the global existence and vanishing dispersion limit of\nstrong/classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional\nbarotropic compressible quantum Navier-Stokes equations, which consists of the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a linearly density-dependent\nviscosity and a nonlinear third-order differential operator known as the\nquantum Bohm potential. The pressure $p(\\rho)=\\rho^\\gamma$ is considered with\n$\\gamma\\geq1$ being a constant. We focus on the case when the viscosity\nconstant $\\nu$ and the Planck constant $\\varepsilon$ are not equal. Under some\nsuitable assumptions on $\\nu,\\varepsilon, \\gamma$, and the initial data, we\nproved the global existence and large-time behavior of strong and classical\nsolutions away from vacuum to the compressible quantum Navier-Stokes equations\nwith arbitrarily large initial data. This result extends the previous ones on\nthe construction of global strong large-amplitude solutions of the compressible\nquantum Navier-Stokes equations to the case $\\nu\\neq\\varepsilon$. Moreover, the\nvanishing dispersion limit for the classical solutions of the quantum\nNavier-Stokes equations is also established with certain convergence rates.

These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely,\nwhen non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves\npropagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned\nfamily, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at\nthe Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the\npossible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In\nline with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an\ninstability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass\ninflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for\nthe spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing\nthe interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1)\ninitial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to\n$W^{1, 2}\\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q > 2$, along the initial ingoing\ncompact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the\nblack hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference\nblack hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth\ndata suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a\n``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected\nPrice law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and\nrough initial data.",
