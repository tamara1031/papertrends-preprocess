These observables probe the event-by-event eccentricity\nfluctuations in the initial state and the contributions from the dynamic\nevolution of the expanding quark-gluon plasma. The characteristic features\nobserved in previous $p_{\\rm T}$-differential anisotropic flow measurements for\nidentified hadrons with two-particle correlations, namely the mass ordering at\nlow $p_{\\rm T}$ and the approximate scaling with the number of constituent\nquarks at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$, are similarly present in the four-particle\ncorrelations and the combinations of $v_2\\{2\\}$ and $v_2\\{4\\}$. In addition, a\nparticle species dependence of flow fluctuations is observed that could\nindicate a significant contribution from final state hadronic interactions. The\ncomparison between experimental measurements and CoLBT model calculations,\nwhich combine the various physics processes of hydrodynamics, quark\ncoalescence, and jet fragmentation, illustrates their importance over a wide\n$p_{\\rm T}$ range.",

The presence of the proton subshell closure $Z=40$\nallows the existence of particle-hole excitations that produces low-lying\nintruder bands.\n  Purpose: The goal of this work is the study of the nuclear structure of the\neven-even $^{92-102}$Sr isotopes through the accurate description of excitation\nenergies, $B(E2)$ transition rates, nuclear radii and two-neutron separation\nenergies.\n  Method: The interacting boson model with configuration mixing will be the\nframework to calculate all the observables of the Sr isotopes. Only two types\nof configurations will be considered, namely, 0particle-0hole and\n2particle-2hole excitations. The parameters of the model are determined using a\nleast-squares procedure for the excitation energies and the $B(E2)$ transition\nrates.\n  Results: For the whole chain of isotopes, the value of excitation energies,\n$B(E2)$'s, two-neutron separation energies, nuclear radii, and isotope shifts\nhave been obtained, with a good agreement between theory and experiment. Also,\na detailed analysis of the wave functions have been performed and, finally, the\nmean-field energy surfaces and the value of the nuclear deformation, $\\beta$,\nhave been obtained.\n  Conclusions: The presence of low-lying intruder states in even-even Sr\nisotopes have been confirmed and its connection with the onset of deformation\nhas been clarified. Lightest Sr isotopes present a spherical structure while\nthe heaviest ones are clearly deformed. The rapid onset of deformation at\nneutron number $60$ is due to the crossing of the regular and intruder\nconfigurations and, moreover, both families of states present an increase of\ndeformation with the neutron number.",

Purpose: Investigate the\nbreakup decay rate of $^9$Be+p at 2.72A MeV, where the $\\alpha$+$\\alpha$+n\nconfiguration is mainly accessible. Compare and interpret data at 2.72A MeV and\n5.67A MeV into a 4-body CDCC formalism; Point out and discuss couplings to\ncontinuum. Methods: Our experimental method includes an exclusive breakup\nmeasurement in a full kinematic approach of $^9$Be incident on a proton target\nat 2.72A MeV, together with elastic scattering and other reaction channels\nmeasurements under the same experimental conditions. The interpretation of the\ndata at 2.72A MeV and 5.67A MeV is considered in a 4-body CDCC approach, using\nthe Transformed Harmonic Oscillator method for the 3-body projectile. Results:\nAn elastic scattering angular distribution at 2.72A MeV is measured, which\ncompares very well with CDCC calculations, indicating a strong coupling to\ncontinuum. At the same energy, the measured breakup and total reaction cross\nsections present good agreement with the calculated values. Further on, the\nelastic scattering and breakup cross section data at 5.67A MeV are found in\nvery good agreement with the CDCC calculations. The present results support\nfurther our 3-body model for the structure of $^9$Be, validating relevant\nradiative reaction rates obtained previously.",

          "abstract": "The $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction plays a major role both in the\nBBN producing the majority of the primordial $^7$Li, and in the pp-chain, where\nit is the branching point. As a few-nucleon system, this reaction is often used\nto validate ab-initio theoretical calculations and/or test R-matrix theory and\ncode implementations. For the latter, experimental data in an extended energy\nrange is of crucial importance to test the fit and extrapolation capabilities\nof the different codes. The $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction cross\nsection has been measured by several groups up to the first resonance\n($E_{c.m.} \\approx 3$ MeV) in the reaction. However, only one dataset exists\nabove the $^7$Be proton separation threshold measured in a narrow energy range\n($E_{c.m.} = 4.0-4.4$ MeV). In this work we extend the available experimental\ncapture cross section database to the energy range of known $^7$Be levels. The\nactivation method was used. The experiment was performed using a thin-window\ngas cell with two high-purity Al foils as entrance and exit windows. The\nactivity of the $^7$Be nuclei implanted in the exit/catcher foil was measured\nby detecting the yield of the emitted $\\gamma$~rays using shielded high-purity\ngermanium detectors. New experimental $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction\ncross section data were obtained for the first time in the $E_{c.m.}=4.3-8.3$\nMeV energy region. The new dataset with about 0.2 MeV step covers the energy\nrange of known levels and particle separation thresholds. No prominent\nstructures are observer around the $^7$Be levels. The reaction cross section is\nslowly increasing with increasing energy. Above the $^6$Li$+p_1$ threshold, a\ndecrease starts in the cross section trend. The overall structure of the cross\nsection suggest a broad resonance peaking around $E_x=7.5$ MeV $^7$Be\nexcitation energy, with a width of 8 MeV.",

Even higher densities are probed inside massive neutron stars such as\nPSR J0740+6620.

At\nnuclear densities these are connected to microscopic calculations of neutron\nmatter based on chiral effective field theory interactions. In addition to the\nnew NICER data for this heavy neutron star, we separately study constraints\nfrom the radio timing mass measurement of PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational\nwave events of binary neutron stars GW190425 and GW170817, and for the latter\nthe associated kilonova AT2017gfo.

          "abstract": "Neutron lifetime is a critical parameter in the Standard Model. Its\nmeasurements using, particularly, the beamline and ultracold neutron storage\ntechniques reveals serious tension. The status of the tension between various\nmeasurements have been presented, in light of the insights provided by the\n$\\beta$-decay correlation measurements. When ultracold neutrons are stored in\nmaterial bottles, they can be lost to various processes, such as $\\beta$-decay\nand up-scattering on material walls. Here, we revisit the lifetime measurement\nin a material storage bottle, dominated by losses from scattering off the walls\nof the storage chamber. The neutron energy spectra and its associated\nuncertainties were, for the first time, well characterized. Such models have\nbeen used in the extraction of mean time between wall bounces, which is a key\nparameter for neutron storage disappearance experiments in search of neutron\noscillation. A comparison between the loss model and the number of neutrons\nstored in a single chamber, used for the neutron electric dipole moment search,\nallowed us to extract a neutron lifetime of\n$\\tau^*_n=879~({+158}/{-78})_{\\text{stat.}}~(+230/-114)_{\\text{sys.}}~\\text{s~~(68.3\\%\nC.I.)}$.

In doing so, we finally\nhighlight the underestimation of the uncertainties in the previous Monte Carlo\nsimulations of experiments using ultracold neutron storage in material bottles.",
