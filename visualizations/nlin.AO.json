We develop such a type of approach that bridges between\nmicroscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model\nincorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory\nfeatures two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and\ngenerates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent\nexperiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral\ncrystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and\nproliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type\nof surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that\nresults in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal\nfor the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals,\nparticularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald\nripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening\nto grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an\nincrease of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the\nsingle-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle\ntransverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain\nlocomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation,\nself-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design\nand control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic\nmaterials.",

Its ubiquitous presence in nature, science, and technology\nhas fascinated the scientific community over the decades. Moreover, a great\ndeal of research has been, and is still being, devoted to understand various\nphysical aspects of the subject. In particular, the study of interacting\n\\textit{active} particles has led to exotic phase transitions in such systems\nwhich have opened up a new research front-line. Motivated by this line of work,\nin this paper, we study the directional synchrony among self-propelled\nparticles. These particles move inside a bounded region, and crucially their\ndirections are also coupled with spatial degrees of freedom. We assume that the\ndirectional coupling between two particles is influenced by the relative\nspatial distance which changes over time. Furthermore, the nature of the\ninfluence is considered to be both short and long-ranged. We explore the phase\ntransition scenario in both the cases and propose an approximation technique\nwhich enables us to analytically find the critical transition point. The\nresults are further supported with numerical simulations. Our results have\npotential importance in the study of active systems like bird flocks, fish\nschools and swarming robots where spatial influence plays a pertinent role.",

We present four microscopic models with different\ntypes of repulsive interactions between particles and their associated\nmacroscopic models, which are formally obtained using different coarse-graining\nmethods. The macroscopic limits are integro-differential equations for the\ndensity in phase space (positions and orientations) of the particles and may\ninclude nonlinearities in both the diffusive and advective components. In\ncontrast to passive particles, systems of active particles can undergo phase\nseparation without any attractive interactions, a mechanism known as\nmotility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We explore the onset of such a\ntransition for each model in the parameter space of occupied volume fraction\nand P\\'eclet number via a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations\nat both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. We establish that one of the\nmodels, namely the mean-field model which assumes long-range repulsive\ninteractions, cannot explain the emergence of MIPS. In contrast, MIPS is\nobserved for the remaining three models that assume short-range interactions\nthat localize the interaction terms in space.",

          "abstract": "A prominent type of collective dynamics in networks of coupled oscillators is\nthe coexistence of coherently and incoherently oscillating domains, known as\nchimera states. Chimera states exhibit various macroscopic dynamics with\ndifferent motions of the Kuramoto order parameter. Stationary, periodic and\nquasiperiodic chimeras are known to occur in two-population networks of\nidentical phase oscillators. In a three-population network of identical\nKuramoto-Sakaguchi phase oscillators, stationary and periodic symmetric\nchimeras were previously studied on a reduced manifold in which two populations\nbehaved identically [Phys. Rev. E 82, 016216 (2010)]. In this paper, we study\nthe full phase space dynamics of such three-population networks. We demonstrate\nthe existence of macroscopic chaotic chimera attractors that exhibit aperiodic\nantiphase dynamics of the order parameters. We observe these chaotic chimera\nstates in both finite-sized systems and the thermodynamic limit outside the\nOtt-Antonsen manifold. The chaotic chimera states coexist with a stable chimera\nsolution on the Ott-Antonsen manifold that displays periodic antiphase\noscillation of the two incoherent populations and with a symmetric stationary\nchimera solution, resulting in tri-stability of chimera states. Of these three\ncoexisting chimera states, only the symmetric stationary chimera solution\nexists in the symmetry-reduced manifold.",

          "abstract": "Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed\nacross a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model\nprovides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among\ncoupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However,\nmany real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be\neffectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that\nhigher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state,\nmaking it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite\nenriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case.\nThrough extensive numerical analysis of the higher-order Kuramoto model, we\nfind that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against\nsynchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it. This\nresult is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained\nbudget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation\ninvolving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on\neither interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the\nrole of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to\ndesign principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.",

          "abstract": "We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects\nthat are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence\nrelationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such\nsystems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is\nespecially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free\nenergy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical\nsystems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a\nparsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it\ndoes, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using\nthe FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of\nvariational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a\nLyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative\nmodels to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a\nparticular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory\nenables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among\nsubsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the\nFEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the\nliteral sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the\n`explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy\ngradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.",

Importantly, this class of systems encompasses\nMarkovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored\nnoise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and\nmeso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a\nBayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with\ntheir environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the\ninternal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with\nvariational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3)\nWe refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is\nmore specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This\nsays that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising\na quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy\nprinciple, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and\nsimulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising\nfree energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.",

Reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a new perspective, distinct from imitation learning in evolutionary\ngames, for exploring the mechanisms underlying its emergence.

Players in the real world, however,\noptimize their policies based not only on their histories but also on the\nhistories of their co-players, and the game is played in a group manner. In the\nwork, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in the PGG under the\nother-regarding reinforcement learning evolutionary game (OR-RLEG) on\nhypergraph by combining the Q-learning algorithm and evolutionary game\nframework, where other players' action history is incorporated and the game is\nplayed on hypergraphs. Our results show that as the synergy factor increases,\nthe parameter interval is divided into three distinct regions, the absence of\ncooperation (AC), medium cooperation (MC), and high cooperation (HC),\naccompanied by two abrupt transitions in the cooperation level near two\ntransition points, respectively. Interestingly, we identify regular and\nanti-coordinated chessboard structures in the spatial pattern that positively\ncontribute to the first cooperation transition but adversely affect the second.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical treatment for the first transition with\nan approximated first transition point and reveal that players with a\nlong-sighted perspective and low exploration rate are more likely to\nreciprocate kindness with each other, thus facilitating the emergence of\ncooperation.

We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on\nthe macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying\npost-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population\nactivities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next\ngeneration neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the\nderivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible\nmacroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled\nneural masses. In single populations SFA favours the emergence of population\nbursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for\ninhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of\nadaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken\nsymmetry: namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase\npopulation spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new\ncollective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among\nthe fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from\nanti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting\nphenomena.

These networks use simple spiking neuron models, such as the\n$\\theta$-neuron or the quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neuron, that\nreplicate the essential features of real neural dynamics. Interactions between\nneurons are modeled with infinitely narrow pulses, or spikes, rather than the\nmore complex dynamics of real synapses. To make these networks biologically\nmore plausible, it has been proposed that they must also account for the finite\nwidth of the pulses, which can have a significant impact on the network\ndynamics. However, the derivation and interpretation of these pulses is\ncontradictory and the impact of the pulse shape on the network dynamics is\nlargely unexplored. Here, I take a comprehensive approach to pulse-coupling in\nnetworks of QIF and $\\theta$-neurons. I argue that narrow pulses activate\nvoltage-dependent synaptic conductances and show how to implement them in QIF\nneurons such that their effect can last through the phase after the spike.\nUsing an exact low-dimensional description for networks of globally coupled\nspiking neurons, I prove for instantaneous interactions that collective\noscillations emerge due to an effective coupling through the mean voltage.

          "abstract": "Many recent works in control of electric power systems have investigated\ntheir synchronization through global performance metrics under external\ndisturbances. The approach is motivated by fundamental changes in the operation\nof power grids, in particular by the substitution of conventional power plants\nwith new renewable sources of electrical energy. This substitution will\nsimultaneously increase fluctuations in power generation and reduce the\navailable mechanical inertia. It is crucial to understand how strongly these\ntwo evolutions will impact grid stability. With very few, mostly numerical\nexceptions, earlier works on performance metrics had to rely on unrealistic\nassumptions of grid homogeneity. Here we show that a modified spectral\ndecomposition can tackle that issue in inhomogeneous power grids in cases where\ndisturbances occur on time scales that are long compared to the intrinsic time\nscales of the grid. We find in particular that the magnitude of the transient\nexcursion generated by disturbances with long characteristic times does not\ndepend on inertia. For continental-size, high-voltage power grids, this\ncorresponds to power fluctuations that are correlated on time scales of few\nseconds or more. We conclude that power fluctuations arising from new\nrenewables will not require per se the deployment of additional rotational\ninertia. We numerically illustrate our results on the IEEE 118-Bus test case\nand a model of the synchronous grid of continental Europe.",

          "abstract": "In this work we model the dynamics of power grids in terms of a two-layer\nnetwork, and use the Italian high voltage power grid as a proof-of-principle\nexample. The first layer in our model represents the power grid consisting of\ngenerators and consumers, while the second layer represents a dynamic\ncommunication network that serves as a controller of the first layer. The\ndynamics of the power grid is modelled by the Kuramoto model with inertia,\nwhile the communication layer provides a control signal P_i^c for each\ngenerator to improve frequency synchronization within the power grid. We\npropose different realizations of the communication layer topology and of the\ncontrol signal, and test the control performances in presence of generators\nwith stochastic power output. When using a control topology that allows all\ngenerators to exchange information, we find that a control scheme aimed to\nminimize the frequency difference between adjacent nodes operates very\nefficiently even against the worst scenarios with the strongest perturbations.\nOn the other hand, for a control topology where the generators possess the same\ncommunication links as in the power grid layer, a control scheme aimed at\nrestoring the synchronization frequency in the neighborhood of the controlled\nnode turns out to be more efficient.",

          "year": "2022-03",
          "abstract": "Decarbonization in the energy sector has been accompanied by an increased\npenetration of new renewable energy sources in electric power systems. Such\nsources differ from traditional productions in that, first, they induce larger,\nundispatchable fluctuations in power generation and second, they lack inertia.\nTherefore, substituting new renewables for traditional generation induces\nstronger and more frequent disturbances and modifies the way disturbances\npropagate across AC electric power grids. Recent measurements have indeed\nreported long, non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of local grid-frequency\ndata. Large frequency deviations may induce grid instabilities, leading in\nworst-case scenarios to cascading failures and large-scale blackouts. In this\nmanuscript, we investigate how correlated noise disturbances, characterized by\nthe cumulants of their distribution, propagate through meshed, high-voltage\npower grids. We show that for a single source of fluctuations,\nnon-Gaussianities in the form of finite skewness and positive kurtosis of the\nnoise distribution propagate over the entire network when the noise correlation\ntime is larger than the network's intrinsic time scales, but that they vanish\nover short distances if the noise fluctuates rapidly. We furthermore show that\na Berry-Esseen theorem leads to the vanishing of non-Gaussianities as the\nnumber of uncorrelated noise sources increases. Our results show that the\npersistence of non-Gaussian fluctuations of feed-in power have a global impact\non power-grid dynamics when they fluctuate over time scales larger than the\nintrinsic time scales of the system, which, we argue, is the relevant regime in\nreal power grids. Our predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations on\nrealistic models of power grids.",
