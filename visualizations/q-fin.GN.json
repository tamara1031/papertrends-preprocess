          "abstract": "Lending protocols in decentralized finance enable the permissionless exchange\nof capital from lenders to borrowers without relying on a trusted third party\nfor clearing or market-making. Interest rates are set by the supply and demand\nof capital according to a pre-defined function. In the lead-up to The Merge:\nEthereum blockchain's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake\n(PoS), a fraction of the Ethereum ecosystem announced plans of continuing with\na PoW-chain. Owners of ETH - whether their ETH was borrowed or not - would hold\nthe native tokens on each chain. This development alarmed lending protocols.\nThey feared spiking ETH borrowing rates would lead to mass liquidations which\ncould undermine their viability. Thus, the decentralized autonomous\norganization running the protocols saw no alternative to intervention -\nrestricting users' ability to borrow.\n  We investigate the effects of the merge and the aforementioned intervention\non the two biggest lending protocols on Ethereum: AAVE and Compound. Our\nanalysis finds that borrowing rates were extremely volatile, jumping by two\norders of magnitude, and borrowing at times reached 100% of the available\nfunds. Despite this, no spike in mass liquidations or irretrievable loans\nmaterialized. Further, we are the first to quantify and analyze\nhard-fork-arbitrage, profiting from holding debt in the native blockchain token\nduring a hard fork. We find that arbitrageurs transferred tokens to centralized\nexchanges which at the time were worth more than 13 Mio US$, money that was\neffectively extracted from the platforms' lenders.",

          "year": "2025-02",
          "abstract": "We propose a mechanism embedded into the foundational infrastructure of a\nblockchain network, designed to improve the utility of idle network resources,\nwhilst enhancing market microstructure efficiency during block production by\nleveraging both network-owned and external capital. By systematically seeking\nto use idle network resources for internally capture arbitrageable\ninefficiencies, the mechanism mitigates extractable value leakage, reduces\nexecution frictions, and improves price formation across venues. This framework\noptimises resource allocation by incentivising an ordered set of transactions\nto be identified and automatically executed at the end of each block,\nredirecting any realised arbitrage income - to marketplaces operating on the\nhost blockchain network (and other stakeholders), which may have otherwise been\nextracted as rent by external actors. Crucially, this process operates without\nintroducing additional inventory risk, ensuring that the network remains a\nneutral facilitator of price discovery. While the systematic framework\ngoverning the distribution of these internally captured returns is beyond the\nscope of this work, reinvesting them to support the ecosystem deployed on the\nhost blockchain network is envisioned to endogenously enhance liquidity,\nstrengthen transactional efficiency, and promote the organic adoption of the\nblockchain for end users. This mechanism is designed specifically for Supra's\nblockchain and seeks to maximally utilise its highly efficient automation\nframework to enhance the blockchain network's efficiency.",

          "abstract": "To non-experts, the traditional Centralized Finance (CeFi) ecosystem may seem\nobscure, because users are typically not aware of the underlying rules or\nagreements of financial assets and products. Decentralized Finance (DeFi),\nhowever, is making its debut as an ecosystem claiming to offer transparency and\ncontrol, which are partially attributable to the underlying integrity-protected\nblockchain, as well as currently higher financial asset yields than CeFi. Yet,\nthe boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut.\n  In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and\nDeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We\nprovide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi\nservice. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT\nstablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the\neconomic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We conclude this work with the\nexploration of possible synergies between CeFi and DeFi.",

Using a simple 1:1 economic\nABM and introducing the new carbon-to-profit ratio, we identify firms that\nbecome unprofitable and default, and estimate the respective loan write-offs.\nWe find that 45% of all companies are directly exposed to carbon pricing.

          "year": "2024-09",
          "abstract": "Context: Over the last decade, the forestry sector has undergone substantial\nchanges, evolving from a post-2008 financial crisis landscape to incorporating\npolicies favoring sustainable and green alternatives, especially after the 2015\nParis agreement. This evolution was drastically disrupted with the advent of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing unprecedented interruptions in supply\nchains, product markets, and data collection. Grasping the aftermath of the\nCOVID-19, regional instances of the forest supply chain sector need synthetic\npictures of their present state and future opportunities for emerging wood\nproducts and better regional-scale carbon balance. But given the impact of\nCOVID-19 lock-down on data collection, the production of such synthetic\npictures has become more complex, yet essential. This was the case for the\nregional supply chain of the Grand-Est region in France that we studied.\n  Aims: For this study, our aim was to demonstrate that an integrated\nmethodology could provide such synthetic picture even though we sued\nheterogenous sources of data and different analytical objectives: i.e. (1)\nretrospectively evaluate the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain\noutcomes within the forestry sector; and then (2) retrospectively explore\npossible options of structural change of regional supply chain that would be\nrequired to simultaneously recover from COVID-19 and transit to new objectives\nin line with the extraction of new bio-molecules from wood biomass, and with\nthe reduction of the regional scale carbon footprint (in line with the IPCC\nParis Agreement)\n  Methods: To achieve this, our methodological approach was decomposed into\nthree steps. We first used a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) recently conducted on\nthe forestry sector in the Grand Est region to establish a Sankey diagram (i.e.\na schematic representation of industrial sectors and biomass flows along the\nsupply chain) for the pre-Covid-19 period (2014-2018). Then we compared\npre-Covid-19 Sankey diagram to the only source of data we could access from the\npost-Covid-19 period (2020-2021) in order to estimate the impact of Covid-19.\nFinally, we used as input the reconciled supply chain model into a\nconsequential Wood Product Model (WPMs), called CAT (carbon accounting tool) in\norder to compare three prospective scenarios: (1) a scenario that projected\n2020-2021 Covid-19 conditions and assumed pre-Covid-19 business as usual\npractices, (2) a scenario illustrating the consequence or rerouting some of the\nbiomass to satisfy the expected increase in pulp and paper production to\nsatisfy the needs of the industry after Covid-19, and (3) a scenario that\nexplored new opportunities in term of extraction of novel bio-molecules by the\nemerging biochemical wood industry. For every scenario we also evaluated the\nregional carbon gains and losses that these changes implied.\n  Results: Our study conducted a detailed analysis of the impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the forestry sector's supply chain in the Grand Est\nregion, using a dynamic and integrated Wood Product Model. We found significant\ndisruptions during the pandemic period, with notable declines in industrial\nwood chips and timber hardwood production by 41.8% and 40%, respectively.\nConversely, there were substantial increases in fuelwood, timber sawdust, and\ntimber softwood, rising by 14.15%, 44.23%, and 15.29% respectively. These\nfluctuations underscore the resilience and vulnerabilities within the regional\nwood supply chain. Our findings also emphasize the potential for strategic\nrerouting of biomass flows to meet changing industry demands, which could play\na crucial role in supporting the sector's recovery and adaptation to\npost-pandemic conditions.\n  Discussion and conclusion: In addition, our study recognizes the limitations\nof the current approach combining MFA and WPM and suggests potential areas of\nenhancement. Ultimately, our findings shed light on the need to develop more\nintegrated analytical methods to provide useful synthetic pictures of regional\nscale supply chains, when there is a need to adapt it to evolving situations\nand complex data landscapes.",

In this approach, we\ndirectly relate state variables to portfolio weights, rather than firstly\nmodeling the return distribution and subsequently estimating the portfolio\nchoice. The method captures nonlinearity among the state (predicting) variables\nand portfolio weights without assuming any particular distribution of returns\nand other data, without fitting a model with a fixed number of predicting\nvariables to data and without estimating any parameters.
