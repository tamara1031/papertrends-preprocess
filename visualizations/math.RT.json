          "abstract": "Several finite complex reflection groups have a braid group which is\nisomorphic to a torus knot group. The reflection group is obtained from the\ntorus knot group by declaring meridians to have order $k$ for some $k\\geq 2$,\nand meridians are mapped to reflections. We study all possible quotients of\ntorus knot groups obtained by requiring meridians to have finite order. Using\nthe theory of $J$-groups of Achar and Aubert, we show that these groups behave\nlike (in general infinite) complex reflection groups of rank two. The large\nfamily of \"toric reflection groups\" which we obtain includes, among others, all\nfinite complex reflection groups of rank two with a single conjugacy class of\nreflecting hyperplanes, as well as Coxeter's truncations of the $3$-strand\nbraid group. We classify these toric reflection groups and explain why the\ncorresponding torus knot group can be naturally considered as its braid group.\nIn particular, this yields a new infinite family of reflection-like groups\nadmitting a braid group which is a Garside group. Moreover, we show that a\ntoric reflection group has cyclic center by showing that the quotient by the\ncenter is isomorphic to the alternating subgroup of a Coxeter group of rank\nthree. To this end we use the fact that the center of the alternating subgroup\nof an irreducible, infinite Coxeter group of rank at least three is trivial.\nSeveral ingredients of the proofs are purely Coxeter-theoretic, and might be of\nindependent interest.",

          "abstract": "Complex reflection groups of rank two are precisely the finite groups in the\nfamily of groups that we call J-reflection groups. These groups are particular\ncases of J-groups as defined by Achar & Aubert in 2008. The family of\nJ-reflection groups generalises both complex reflection groups of rank two and\ntoric reflection groups, a family of groups defined and studied by Gobet. We\ngive uniform presentations by generators and relations of J-reflection groups,\nwhich coincide with the presentations given by Brou\\'e, Malle and Rouquier when\nthe groups are finite. In particular, these presentations provide uniform\npresentations for complex reflection groups of rank two where the generators\nare reflections (however the proof uses the classification of irreducible\ncomplex reflection groups). Moreover, we show that the center of J-reflection\ngroups is cyclic, generalising what happens for irreducible complex reflection\ngroups of rank two and toric reflection groups. Finally, we classify\nJ-reflection groups up to reflection isomorphisms.",

          "abstract": "The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial\ngeneralisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was\nintroduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the\nbraid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the\ncomplex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the\nisomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism\ntypes of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these\nbraid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same\ntime, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the\ncenter of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient.\nFinally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of\n$J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual\nGarside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection\ngroups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups\nprovides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex\nreflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.",
