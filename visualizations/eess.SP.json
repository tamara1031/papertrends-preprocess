          "year": "2021-05",
          "abstract": "EEG is the gold standard for seizure detection in the newborn infant, but EEG\ninterpretation in the preterm group is particularly challenging; trained\nexperts are scarce and the task of interpreting EEG in real-time is arduous.\nPreterm infants are reported to have a higher incidence of seizures compared to\nterm infants. Preterm EEG morphology differs from that of term infants, which\nimplies that seizure detection algorithms trained on term EEG may not be\nappropriate. The task of developing preterm specific algorithms becomes\nextra-challenging given the limited amount of annotated preterm EEG data\navailable. This paper explores novel deep learning (DL) architectures for the\ntask of neonatal seizure detection in preterm infants. The study tests and\ncompares several approaches to address the problem: training on data from\nfull-term infants; training on data from preterm infants; training on\nage-specific preterm data and transfer learning. The system performance is\nassessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 575h in duration.\nIt is shown that the accuracy of a validated term-trained EEG seizure detection\nalgorithm, based on a support vector machine classifier, when tested on preterm\ninfants falls well short of the performance achieved for full-term infants. An\nAUC of 88.3% was obtained when tested on preterm EEG as compared to 96.6%\nobtained when tested on term EEG. When re-trained on preterm EEG, the\nperformance marginally increases to 89.7%. An alternative DL approach shows a\nmore stable trend when tested on the preterm cohort, starting with an AUC of\n93.3% for the term-trained algorithm and reaching 95.0% by transfer learning\nfrom the term model using available preterm data.",

          "title": "A lightweight hybrid CNN-LSTM model for ECG-based arrhythmia detection",
          "year": "2022-08",
          "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequent and routine diagnostic tool used\nfor monitoring heart electrical signals and evaluating its functionality. The\nhuman heart can suffer from a variety of diseases, including cardiac\narrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rhythm that in severe cases can\nlead to heart stroke and can be diagnosed via ECG recordings. Since early\ndetection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and\nautomated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals\nhave received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper\nintroduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8\ndifferent cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning\nmethod, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG\nsignals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The\nrhythm classification was done by an 11-layer network in an end-to-end manner\nwithout the need for hand-crafted manual feature extraction. Results: In order\nto evaluate the proposed technique, ECG signals are chosen from the two\nphysionet databases, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the long-term AF\ndatabase. The proposed deep learning framework based on the combination of\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) showed\npromising results than most of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed\nmethod reaches the mean diagnostic accuracy of 98.24%. Conclusion: A trained\nmodel for arrhythmia classification using diverse ECG signals were successfully\ndeveloped and tested. Significance: Since the present work uses a light\nclassification technique with high diagnostic accuracy compared to other\nnotable methods, it could successfully be implemented in holter monitor devices\nfor arrhythmia detection.",

          "year": "2021-05",
          "abstract": "In the context of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based driver drowsiness\nrecognition, it is still challenging to design a calibration-free system, since\nEEG signals vary significantly among different subjects and recording sessions.\nMany efforts have been made to use deep learning methods for mental state\nrecognition from EEG signals. However, existing work mostly treats deep\nlearning models as black-box classifiers, while what have been learned by the\nmodels and to which extent they are affected by the noise in EEG data are still\nunderexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel convolutional neural network\ncombined with an interpretation technique that allows sample-wise analysis of\nimportant features for classification. The network has a compact structure and\ntakes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a\nspatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average\naccuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness\nrecognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of\n53.40%-72.68% and state-of-the-art deep learning methods of 71.75%-75.19%.\nInterpretation results indicate the model has learned to recognize biologically\nmeaningful features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong\nindicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also\nexplore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples with the interpretation\ntechnique and discuss potential ways to improve the recognition accuracy. Our\nwork illustrates a promising direction on using interpretable deep learning\nmodels to discover meaningful patterns related to different mental states from\ncomplex EEG signals.",

Each reflecting element of active RISs is assisted\nby an amplifier such that the incident signal can be reflected and amplified\ninstead of only being reflected as in passive RIS-aided systems. This work\naddresses the practical challenge that, on the one hand, in active RIS-aided\nsystems the perfect individual CSI of the RIS-aided channels cannot be acquired\ndue to the lack of signal processing power at the active RISs, but, on the\nother hand, this CSI is required to calculate the expected system data rate and\nRIS transmit power needed for transceiver design. To address this issue, we\nfirst derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable rate and the\naverage RIS transmit power based on partial CSI of the RIS-aided channels.\nThen, we formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem for jointly\noptimizing the active beamforming at both the base station (BS) and the RIS.\nThis problem is then tackled using the majorization--minimization (MM)\nalgorithm framework, and, for each iteration, semi-closed-form solutions for\nthe BS and RIS beamforming are derived based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nconditions. To ensure the quality of service (QoS) of each user, we further\nformulate a rate outage constrained beamforming problem, which is solved using\nthe Bernstein-Type inequality (BTI) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)\ntechniques. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently\novercome the challenges imposed by imperfect CSI in active RIS-aided wireless\nsystems.",

Using the proposed method, the cascaded MIMO\nchannel parts can be estimated separately, up to trivial scaling factors.\nCompared with the S-RIS systems, we show that if the RIS elements of a S-RIS\nsystem are distributed carefully between the two RISs in a D-RIS system, the\ntraining overhead can be reduced and the estimation accuracy can also be\nincreased. Therefore, D-RIS systems can be seen as an appealing approach to\nfurther increase the coverage, capacity, and efficiency of future wireless\nnetworks compared to S-RIS systems.",

In ISAC systems, standard\ncommunication waveforms can be adapted for sensing, as the sensing receiver\n(co-located with the transmitter) has knowledge of the communication message\nand consequently the waveform. However, the randomness of communications may\nresult in waveforms that have high sidelobes masking weak targets. Thus, it is\ndesirable to refine communication waveforms to improve the sensing performance\nby reducing the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). This is similar to the\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) mitigation in orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), in which the OFDM-modulated waveform needs to be refined\nto reduce the PAPR. In this paper, inspired by PAPR reduction algorithms in\nOFDM, we employ trellis shaping in OFDM-based ISAC systems to refine waveforms\nfor specific sensing metrics using convolutional codes and Viterbi decoding. In\nsuch a scheme, the communication data is encoded and then mapped to the\nsignaling constellation in different subcarriers, such that the time-domain\nsidelobes are reduced. An interesting observation is that sidelobe reduction in\nOFDM-based ISAC is dual to PAPR reduction in OFDM, thereby sharing a similar\nsignaling structure.

Based on our solutions, we design an efficient\ncomputing offloading and resource allocation algorithm for intelligent tasks in\nMEC systems. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm\nsignificantly improves the performance of intelligent tasks in MEC systems and\nachieves a flexible trade-off between system revenue and cost considering\nintelligent tasks compared with the benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "The research examined predicting short-duration traffic flow counts with the\nKalman filtering technique (KFT), a computational filtering method. Short-term\ntraffic prediction is an important tool for operation in traffic management and\ntransportation system. The short-term traffic flow value results can be used\nfor travel time estimation by route guidance and advanced traveler information\nsystems. Though the KFT has been tested for homogeneous traffic, its efficiency\nin heterogeneous traffic has yet to be investigated. The research was conducted\non Mirpur Road in Dhaka, near the Sobhanbagh Mosque. The stream contains a\nheterogeneous mix of traffic, which implies uncertainty in prediction. The\npropositioned method is executed in Python using the pykalman library. The\nlibrary is mostly used in advanced database modeling in the KFT framework,\nwhich addresses uncertainty. The data was derived from a three-hour traffic\ncount of the vehicle. According to the Geometric Design Standards Manual\npublished by Roads and Highways Division (RHD), Bangladesh in 2005, the\nheterogeneous traffic flow value was translated into an equivalent passenger\ncar unit (PCU). The PCU obtained from five-minute aggregation was then utilized\nas the suggested model's dataset. The propositioned model has a mean absolute\npercent error (MAPE) of 14.62, indicating that the KFT model can forecast\nreasonably well. The root mean square percent error (RMSPE) shows an 18.73%\naccuracy which is less than 25%; hence the model is acceptable. The developed\nmodel has an R2 value of 0.879, indicating that it can explain 87.9 percent of\nthe variability in the dataset. If the data were collected over a more extended\nperiod of time, the R2 value could be closer to 1.0.",

          "year": "2020-03",
          "abstract": "Traffic problems have seriously affected people's life quality and urban\ndevelopment, and forecasting the short-term traffic congestion is of great\nimportance to both individuals and governments. However, understanding and\nmodeling the traffic conditions can be extremely difficult, and our\nobservations from real traffic data reveal that (1) similar traffic congestion\npatterns exist in the neighboring time slots and on consecutive workdays; (2)\nthe levels of traffic congestion have clear multiscale properties. To capture\nthese characteristics, we propose a novel method named PCNN based on deep\nConvolutional Neural Network, modeling Periodic traffic data for short-term\ntraffic congestion prediction. PCNN has two pivotal procedures: time series\nfolding and multi-grained learning. It first temporally folds the time series\nand constructs a two-dimensional matrix as the network input, such that both\nthe real-time traffic conditions and past traffic patterns are well considered;\nthen with a series of convolutions over the input matrix, it is able to model\nthe local temporal dependency and multiscale traffic patterns. In particular,\nthe global trend of congestion can be addressed at the macroscale; whereas more\ndetails and variations of the congestion can be captured at the microscale.\nExperimental results on a real-world urban traffic dataset confirm that folding\ntime series data into a two-dimensional matrix is effective and PCNN\noutperforms the baselines significantly for the task of short-term congestion\nprediction.",

          "abstract": "Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is\nincreasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time\ngetting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase\naccidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police\nofficers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the\ntraffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of\ninstant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such\nas traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras,\ninductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and\nradio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this\nmethod has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by\ncondition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method\nsuggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a\nsmart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution\namount in that area.

          "abstract": "Fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems are likely to operate in the\ncentimeter-wave (3-30 GHz) and millimeter-wave (30-300 GHz) frequency bands,\nwhere a vast amount of underutilized bandwidth exists world-wide. To assist in\nthe research and development of these emerging wireless systems, a myriad of\nmeasurement studies have been conducted to characterize path loss in urban\nenvironments at these frequencies. The standard theoretical free space (FS) and\nStanford University Interim (SUI) empirical path loss models were recently\nmodified to fit path loss models obtained from measurements performed at 28 GHz\nand 38 GHz, using simple correction factors. In this paper, we provide similar\ncorrection factors for models at 60 GHz and 73 GHz. By imparting slope\ncorrection factors on the FS and SUI path loss models to closely match the\nclose-in (CI) free space reference distance path loss models, millimeter-wave\npath loss can be accurately estimated (with popular models) for 5G cellular\nplanning at 60 GHz and 73 GHz. Additionally, new millimeter-wave beam combining\npath loss models are provided at 28 GHz and 73 GHz by considering the\nsimultaneous combination of signals from multiple antenna pointing directions\nbetween the transmitter and receiver that result in the strongest received\npower. Such directional channel models are important for future adaptive array\nsystems at millimeter-wave frequencies.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor\nfactory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth\nchannel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of\nEngineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes\nthe radio propagation in a representative small factory with diverse machinery\nand open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7\nnon-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) free space\npath loss (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss\nexponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS, PLE is\nsimilar to free-space propagation (e.g., PLE = 2). The RMS delay spread (DS)\ndecreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Also,\nmeasurements show a wider RMS angular spread (AS) in NLOS compared to LOS at\nboth frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These\nobservations in a dense-scatterer factory environment demonstrate\nfrequency-dependent behavior that differs from existing industry-standard 3GPP\nmodels. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation\nmechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust air\ninterface and industrial wireless networks at the upper mid-band FR3 spectrum.",

Compared to mmWave frequencies, the directional NLOS PLEs are lower at FR3\nand FR1(C), while omnidirectional NLOS PLEs are similar, suggesting better\npropagation distances at lower frequencies for links with omnidirectional\nantennas at both ends of the links, but also, importantly, showing that higher\ngain antennas will offer better coverage at higher frequencies when antenna\napertures are kept same over all frequencies. Comparison of the omnidirectional\nand directional RMS delay spread (DS) at FR1(C) and FR3 with mmWave frequencies\nindicates a clear decrease with increasing frequency. The mean spatial lobe and\nomnidirectional RMS angular spread (AS) is found to be wider at 6.75 GHz\ncompared to 16.95 GHz indicating more multipath components are found in the\nazimuthal spatial domain at lower frequencies.",
