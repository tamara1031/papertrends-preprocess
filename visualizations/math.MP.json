In curved\nbackgrounds they close a field dependent gauge algebra governed by an\n$L_\\infty$-algebra which is not a $P_\\infty$-algebra. Our technique produces\nnew all orders constructions which are significantly simpler compared to\nprevious approaches, and we illustrate its applicability in several examples of\ninterest in noncommutative field theory and gravity. We further show that our\nsymplectic embeddings naturally define a $P_\\infty$-structure on the exterior\nalgebra of differential forms on a generic almost Poisson manifold, which\ngeneralizes earlier constructions of differential graded Poisson algebras, and\nsuggests a new approach to defining noncommutative gauge theories beyond the\ngauge sector and the semi-classical limit based on $A_\\infty$-algebras.",

We construct global finite-energy solutions of the Cauchy problem for\nthe Euler-Poisson equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry as\nthe inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the\nNavier-Stokes-Poisson equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing\nviscosity solutions is achieved through entropy analysis, uniform estimates in\n$L^p$, and a more general compensated compactness framework via several new\ningredients. A key estimate is first established for the integrability of the\ndensity over unbounded domains independent of the viscosity coefficient. Then a\nspecial entropy pair is carefully designed by solving a Goursat problem for the\nentropy equation such that a higher integrability of the velocity is\nestablished, which is a crucial step. Moreover, the weak entropy kernel for the\ngeneral pressure law and its fractional derivatives of the required order near\nvacuum ($\\rho=0$) and far-field ($\\rho=\\infty$) are carefully analyzed. Owing\nto the generality of the pressure law, only the $W^{-1,p}_{{\\rm\nloc}}$-compactness of weak entropy dissipation measures with $p\\in [1,2)$ can\nbe obtained; this is rescued by the equi-integrability of weak entropy pairs\nwhich can be established by the estimates obtained above so that the div-curl\nlemma still applies. Finally, based on the above analysis of weak entropy\npairs, the $L^p$ compensated compactness framework for the compressible Euler\nequations with general pressure law is established. This new compensated\ncompactness framework and the techniques developed in this paper should be\nuseful for solving further nonlinear problems with similar features.",

          "abstract": "In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the\nbackground of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological\nconstant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of\nthese perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in\nterms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are\ncomputed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's\nmass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our\nanalysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant\nin shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric\narises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in\n$2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog\ngravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of\nacoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a\nvaluable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy,\nstability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability\nfacilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter\nfields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be\nmore pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton\ngravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for\npotential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory\nsettings using analog models.",

In particular, we consider a characteristic\ninitial value problem where, on the outgoing initial hypersurface, interpreted\nas the event horizon $\\mathcal{H}^+$ of a dynamical black hole, we prescribe:\na) initial data asymptotically approaching a fixed sub-extremal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-de Sitter solution; b) an exponential Price law upper\nbound for the charged scalar field.

Moreover, if the scalar field decays at a\nsufficiently fast rate along $\\mathcal{H}^+$, we show that the renormalized\nHawking mass remains bounded for a large set of initial data.

This\nextension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static\nand spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the\neffects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or\nmatter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This\ngeneralization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of\nblack hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string\ntheory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically\nsymmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive\ntotal mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate\nmonotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general\nsolution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by\nexpressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable\nsymplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant\nobservables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress\ntensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic\nideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and\ncompression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the\nradial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas\nis different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid.

          "abstract": "In this paper we consider three classes of interacting particle systems on\n$\\mathbb Z$: independent random walks, the exclusion process, and the inclusion\nprocess. We allow particles to switch their jump rate (the rate identifies the\ntype of particle) between $1$ (fast particles) and $\\epsilon\\in[0,1]$ (slow\nparticles). The switch between the two jump rates happens at rate\n$\\gamma\\in(0,\\infty)$. In the exclusion process, the interaction is such that\neach site can be occupied by at most one particle of each type. In the\ninclusion process, the interaction takes places between particles of the same\ntype at different sites and between particles of different type at the same\nsite. We derive the macroscopic limit equations for the three systems, obtained\nafter scaling space by $N^{-1}$, time by $N^2$, the switching rate by $N^{-2}$,\nand letting $N\\to\\infty$. The limit equations for the macroscopic densities\nassociated to the fast and slow particles is the well-studied double\ndiffusivity model. This system of reaction-diffusion equations was introduced\nto model polycrystal diffusion and dislocation pipe diffusion, with the goal to\novercome the limitations imposed by Fick's law. In order to investigate the\nmicroscopic out-of-equilibrium properties, we analyse the system on\n$[N]=\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$, adding boundary reservoirs at sites $1$ and $N$ of fast\nand slow particles, respectively. Inside $[N]$ particles move as before, but\nnow particles are injected and absorbed at sites $1$ and $N$ with prescribed\nrates that depend on the particle type. We compute the steady-state density\nprofile and the steady-state current. It turns out that uphill diffusion is\npossible, i.e., the total flow can be in the direction of increasing total\ndensity. This phenomenon, which cannot occur in a single-type particle system,\nis a violation of Fick's law made possible by the switching between types.",

We adopt the Wiener-Hopf method\nto compute the Green function for a cracked half plane, a background for the\nperturbed half plane. We rigorously show that the Green function asymptotically\nsatisfies a universal-direction SRC (uSRC) and radiates purely outgoing at\ninfinity. This helps to propose an implicit transparent boundary condition for\nthe scattered wave, by either a cylindrical incident wave due to a line source\nor a plane incident wave. Then, a well-posedness theory is established via an\nassociated variational formulation. The theory reveals that the scattered wave,\npost-subtracting a known wave field, satisfies the same uSRC so that its\nfar-field pattern is accessible theoretically. For a plane-wave incidence,\nasymptotic analysis shows that merely subtracting reflected plane waves, due to\nnon-uniform heights of the step-like surface at infinity, from the scattered\nwave in respective regions produces a discontinuous wave satisfying the uSRC as\nwell. Numerically, we adopt a previously developed perfectly-matched-layer\n(PML) boundary-integral-equation method to solve the problem.
