          "year": "2023-03",
          "abstract": "We consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning\nin Markov games. A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that,\nwhen adopted by all agents and run independently in a decentralized fashion,\nlead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results\nin normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist\nfor restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to\ndeviations to Markovian policies), the question of whether independent\nno-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was\nopen. We provide a decisive negative resolution this problem, both from a\ncomputational and statistical perspective. We show that:\n  - Under the widely-believed assumption that PPAD-hard problems cannot be\nsolved in polynomial time, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains\nno-regret in general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all\nplayers, even when the game is known to the algorithm designer and the number\nof players is a small constant.\n  - When the game is unknown, no algorithm, regardless of computational\nefficiency, can achieve no-regret without observing a number of episodes that\nis exponential in the number of players.\n  Perhaps surprisingly, our lower bounds hold even for seemingly easier setting\nin which all agents are controlled by a a centralized algorithm. They are\nproven via lower bounds for a simpler problem we refer to as SparseCCE, in\nwhich the goal is to compute a coarse correlated equilibrium that is sparse in\nthe sense that it can be represented as a mixture of a small number of product\npolicies. The crux of our approach is a novel application of aggregation\ntechniques from online learning, whereby we show that any algorithm for the\nSparseCCE problem can be used to compute approximate Nash equilibria for\nnon-zero sum normal-form games.",

          "abstract": "We study a new class of Markov games, \\emph(multi-player) zero-sum Markov\nGames} with \\emph{Networked separable interactions} (zero-sum NMGs), to model\nthe local interaction structure in non-cooperative multi-agent sequential\ndecision-making. We define a zero-sum NMG as a model where {the payoffs of the\nauxiliary games associated with each state are zero-sum and} have some\nseparable (i.e., polymatrix) structure across the neighbors over some\ninteraction network. We first identify the necessary and sufficient conditions\nunder which an MG can be presented as a zero-sum NMG, and show that the set of\nMarkov coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) collapses to the set of Markov Nash\nequilibrium (NE) in these games, in that the product of per-state\nmarginalization of the former for all players yields the latter. Furthermore,\nwe show that finding approximate Markov \\emph{stationary} CCE in\ninfinite-horizon discounted zero-sum NMGs is \\texttt{PPAD}-hard, unless the\nunderlying network has a ``star topology''. Then, we propose\nfictitious-play-type dynamics, the classical learning dynamics in normal-form\ngames, for zero-sum NMGs, and establish convergence guarantees to Markov\nstationary NE under a star-shaped network structure. Finally, in light of the\nhardness result, we focus on computing a Markov \\emph{non-stationary} NE and\nprovide finite-iteration guarantees for a series of value-iteration-based\nalgorithms. We also provide numerical experiments to corroborate our\ntheoretical results.",

          "year": "2023-05",
          "abstract": "Learning in games considers how multiple agents maximize their own rewards\nthrough repeated games. Memory, an ability that an agent changes his/her action\ndepending on the history of actions in previous games, is often introduced into\nlearning to explore more clever strategies and discuss the decision-making of\nreal agents like humans. However, such games with memory are hard to analyze\nbecause they exhibit complex phenomena like chaotic dynamics or divergence from\nNash equilibrium. In particular, how asymmetry in memory capacities between\nagents affects learning in games is still unclear. In response, this study\nformulates a gradient ascent algorithm in games with asymmetry memory\ncapacities. To obtain theoretical insights into learning dynamics, we first\nconsider a simple case of zero-sum games. We observe complex behavior, where\nlearning dynamics draw a heteroclinic connection from unstable fixed points to\nstable ones. Despite this complexity, we analyze learning dynamics and prove\nlocal convergence to these stable fixed points, i.e., the Nash equilibria. We\nidentify the mechanism driving this convergence: an agent with a longer memory\nlearns to exploit the other, which in turn endows the other's utility function\nwith strict concavity. We further numerically observe such convergence in\nvarious initial strategies, action numbers, and memory lengths. This study\nreveals a novel phenomenon due to memory asymmetry, providing fundamental\nstrides in learning in games and new insights into computing equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Envy-freeness is one of the most widely studied notions in fair division.\nSince envy-free allocations do not always exist when items are indivisible,\nseveral relaxations have been considered. Among them, possibly the most\ncompelling concept is envy-freeness up to any item (EFX). We study the\nexistence of EFX allocations for general valuations. The existence of EFX\nallocations is a major open problem. For general valuations, it is known that\nan EFX allocation always exists (i) when $n=2$ or (ii) when all agents have\nidentical valuations, where $n$ is the number of agents. it is also known that\nan EFX allocation always exists when one can leave at most $n-1$ items\nunallocated.\n  We develop new techniques and extend some results of additive valuations to\ngeneral valuations on the existence of EFX allocations. We show that an EFX\nallocation always exists (i) when all agents have one of two general valuations\nor (ii) when the number of items is at most $n+3$. We also show that an EFX\nallocation always exists when one can leave at most $n-2$ items unallocated.

First, we show that determining the\nexistence of an envy-free allocation is NP-complete, even in the simple case\nwhen agents have binary additive valuations. Second, we provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm for computing an allocation that satisfies\nenvy-freeness up to one chore (EF1), correcting an existing proof in the\nliterature. A straightforward modification of our algorithm can be used to\ncompute an EF1 allocation for doubly monotone instances (wherein each agent can\npartition the set of items into objective goods and objective chores). Our\nthird result applies to a mixed resources model consisting of indivisible items\nand a divisible, undesirable heterogeneous resource (i.e., a bad cake).

However,\nmost game-theoretic defensive deception approaches have assumed that players\nmaintain consistent views under uncertainty. They do not consider players'\npossible, subjective beliefs formed due to asymmetric information given to\nthem. In this work, we formulate a hypergame between an attacker and a defender\nwhere they can interpret the same game differently and accordingly choose their\nbest strategy based on their respective beliefs. This gives a chance for\ndefensive deception strategies to manipulate an attacker's belief, which is the\nkey to the attacker's decision making. We consider advanced persistent threat\n(APT) attacks, which perform multiple attacks in the stages of the cyber kill\nchain where both the attacker and the defender aim to select optimal strategies\nbased on their beliefs. Through extensive simulation experiments, we\ndemonstrated how effectively the defender can leverage defensive deception\ntechniques while dealing with multi-staged APT attacks in a hypergame in which\nthe imperfect information is reflected based on perceived uncertainty, cost,\nand expected utilities of both attacker and defender, the system lifetime\n(i.e., mean time to security failure), and improved false positive rates in\ndetecting attackers.",

However, such mechanism\ndesign requires the knowledge of time-varying traffic conditions and it is the\nusers themselves to learn and report past road experiences to the social\nplanner (e.g., Waze or Google Maps). When congestion games meet mobile\ncrowdsourcing, it is critical to incentivize selfish users to explore\nnon-shortest paths in the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. First, we\nconsider a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one\ndeterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for users with an average\narrival probability $\\lambda$. We prove that the current myopic routing policy\n(widely used in Waze and Google Maps) misses both exploration (when strong\nhazard belief) and exploitation (when weak hazard belief) as compared to the\nsocial optimum. Due to the myopic policy's under-exploration, we prove that the\ncaused price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than\n\\(\\frac{1}{1-\\rho^{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}}}\\), which can be arbitrarily large as\ndiscount factor \\(\\rho\\rightarrow1\\).

Traffic assignments are traditionally devoted to two main perspectives\non which the well-known Wardropian principlesare inspired: the user equilibrium\nand the system optimum. User equilibrium is a user-driven traffic assignment in\nwhich each user chooses the most convenientpath selfishly. It guarantees that\nfairness among users is respected since, whenthe equilibrium is reached, all\nusers sharing the same origin and destination willexperience the same travel\ntime.

          "abstract": "With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution\nnetworks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy\nmarket has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may\nface imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability\nat the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal\ncoalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or\nsupply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient\nmanagement of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that\nidentify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of\nthe energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the\noptimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a\nstrategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An\nindividual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of\npopulation of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and\nmutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total\nvalue generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when\nthe energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the\nenergy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the\nprofit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during\nperiods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy\non the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the\ntrading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,\naccording to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to\nthe formation of collective value.",

          "title": "Social Factors in P2P Energy Trading Using Hedonic Games",
          "year": "2023-09",
          "abstract": "Lately, the energy communities have gained a lot of attention as they have\nthe potential to significantly contribute to the resilience and flexibility of\nthe energy system, facilitating widespread integration of intermittent\nrenewable energy sources. Within these communities the prosumers can engage in\npeer-to-peer trading, fostering local collaborations and increasing awareness\nabout energy usage and flexible consumption. However, even under these\nfavorable conditions, prosumer engagement levels remain low, requiring trading\nmechanisms that are aligned with their social values and expectations. In this\npaper, we introduce an innovative hedonic game coordination and cooperation\nmodel for P2P energy trading among prosumers which considers the social\nrelationships within an energy community to create energy coalitions and\nfacilitate energy transactions among them. We defined a heuristic that\noptimizes the prosumers coalitions, considering their social and energy price\npreferences and balancing the energy demand and supply within the community. We\nintegrated the proposed hedonic game model into a state-of-the-art\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market and evaluated its performance\nwithin an energy community of prosumers. The evaluation results on a\nblockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market show the effectiveness in\nconsidering social factors when creating coalitions, increasing the total\namount of energy transacted in a market session by 5% compared with other game\ntheory-based solutions. Finally, it shows the importance of the social\ndimensions of P2P energy transactions, the positive social dynamics in the\nenergy community increasing the amount of energy transacted by more than 10%\nwhile contributing to a more balanced energy demand and supply within the\ncommunity.",
