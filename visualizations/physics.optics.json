          "year": "2024-06",
          "abstract": "Correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI) is emerging as a promising approach to\nlight-field imaging (LFI), a technique enabling simultaneous measurement of\nlight intensity distribution and propagation direction from a scene. LFI allows\nsingle-shot 3D sampling, offering fast 3D reconstruction for a wide range of\napplications. However, the array of micro-lenses typically used in LFI to\nobtain 3D information limits image resolution, which rapidly declines with\nenhanced volumetric reconstruction capabilities. CPI addresses this limitation\nby decoupling light-field information measurement using two photodetectors with\nspatial resolution, eliminating the need for micro-lenses. 3D information is\nencoded in a four-dimensional correlation function, which is decoded in\npost-processing to reconstruct images without the resolution loss seen in\nconventional LFI. This paper evaluates the tomographic performance of CPI,\ndemonstrating that the refocusing reconstruction method provides axial\nsectioning capabilities comparable to conventional imaging systems. A\ngeneral-purpose analytical approach based on image fidelity is proposed to\nquantitatively study axial and lateral resolution. This analysis fully\ncharacterizes the volumetric resolution of any CPI architecture, offering a\ncomprehensive evaluation of its imaging performance.",

          "year": "2024-04",
          "abstract": "Imaging in thick biological tissues is often degraded by sample-induced\naberrations, which reduce image quality and resolution, particularly in\nsuper-resolution techniques. While hardware-based adaptive optics, which\ncorrect aberrations using wavefront shaping devices, provide an effective\nsolution, their complexity and cost limit accessibility. Computational methods\noffer simpler alternatives but struggle with complex aberrations due to the\nincoherent nature of fluorescence. Here, we present a deep-tissue\nsuper-resolution imaging framework that addresses these challenges with minimal\nhardware modification. By replacing the photodetector in a standard\nlaser-scanning microscope with a camera, we measure an incoherent response\nmatrix (IRM). A dual deconvolution algorithm is developed to decompose the IRM\ninto excitation and emission optical transfer functions and the object\nspectrum. The proposed method simultaneously corrects excitation and emission\npoint-spread functions (PSFs), achieving a resolution of {\\lambda}/4,\ncomparable to structured illumination microscopy. Unlike existing computational\nmethods that rely on vector decomposition of a single convoluted PSF, our\nmatrix-based approach enhances image reconstruction, particularly for high\nspatial frequency components, enabling super-resolution even in the presence of\ncomplex aberrations. We validated this framework with two-photon\nsuper-resolution imaging, achieving a lateral resolution of 130 nanometers at a\ndepth of 180 micrometers in thick mouse brain tissue.",

          "abstract": "Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant\nadvantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across\nmultiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal\nresolution. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity\nconstraints, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining\nhigh resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the\nQuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel\napproach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back\nfocal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively\nencoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity.\nAdditionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields\ntechnique that provides improved reconstruction quality compared to classical\ndeconvolution methods. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields,\nsignificantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence\nmicroscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in\none shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm\nthrough all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and\nvisualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for\nadvancing biological research and ecological studies.",

          "year": "2024-11",
          "abstract": "The hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) has recently been proposed as a\nmechanism where topological edge states collapse into corner states under the\ninfluence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). However, directly observing\nthis effect is challenging due to the complex frequencies of eigenmodes. In\nthis study, we experimentally observe HSTE corner states using synthetic\ncomplex frequency excitations in a transmission line network. We demonstrate\nthat HSTE induces asymmetric transmission along a specific direction within the\ntopological band gap. Besides HSTE, we identify corner states originating from\nnon-chiral edge states, which are caused by the unbalanced effective onsite\nenergy shifts at the boundaries of the network. Furthermore, our results\nsuggest that whether the bulk interior is Hermitian or non-Hermitian is not a\nkey factor for HSTE. Instead, the HSTE states can be realized and relocated\nsimply by adjusting the non-Hermitian distribution at the boundaries. Our\nresearch has deepened the understanding of a range of issues regarding HSTE,\npaving the way for advancements in the design of non-Hermitian topological\ndevices.",

          "abstract": "Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in non-Hermitian lattice systems, associated\nwith a point gap on the complex energy plane, has attracted great theoretical\nand experimental interest. Much less is studied on the so-called second-order\nnon-Hermitian skin effect, where the bulk does not support a point gap but\nlocalization at the corner still occurs. This work discovers a class of hybrid\nskin-topological modes as the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect without\nasymmetric couplings. Specifically, by only adding gain/loss to two-dimensional\nChern insulators and so long as the gain/loss strength does not close the line\ngap, all the topological edge states are localized at one corner under the open\nboundary condition, with the bulk states extended. The resultant non-Hermitian\nChern bands can be still topologically characterized by Chern numbers, whereas\nthe hybrid skin-topological modes are understood via some auxiliary Hermitian\nsystems that belong to either intrinsic or extrinsic second-order topological\ninsulator phases. By proposing an innovative construction of auxiliary\nHamiltonian, our generic route to hybrid skin-topological modes is further\nsuccessfully extended to nonequilibrium topological systems with gain and loss,\nwhere the anomalous Floquet band topology is no longer captured by band Chern\nnumbers. The extension thus leads to the intriguing finding of nonequilibrium\nhybrid skin-topological modes. In addition to offering a straightforward route\nto experimental realization of hybrid topological-skin effects, this study also\nopens up a promising perspective for the understanding of corner localization\nby revealing the synergy of three important concepts, namely, non-Hermitian\ntopological insulator, second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, and second-order\ntopological insulator.",

Under\nweak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can\nbe neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode\nis large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective\nstrong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or\n``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality\nfactor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within\na cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission\nand the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as\noptical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward\nexplanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in\nmolecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved\nwithout the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this\nsimple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent\nnonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear\ndistinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through\nclassical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics\napproach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that\nnecessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can\noccur in the weak coupling regime.

In a thermal bath with pumping,\nthese atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The\nmodel with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous\nemission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal\nrelaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern\ndynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation\nrate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later\nstabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction\nstrength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two\norders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a\nstrong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show\nPlanckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band\ngaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker\nlight-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime,\nthe dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning\nto steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state\nelectron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian\nemission.
