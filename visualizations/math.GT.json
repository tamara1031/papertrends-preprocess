Such a triple (G,X,H) consists of a group G acting on a\nGromov hyperbolic space X, acylindrically along a finitely generated subgroup H\nwhich is quasi-isometrically embedded by the action. Examples include strongly\nquasi-convex subgroups of relatively hyperbolic groups, convex cocompact\nsubgroups of mapping class groups, many known convex cocompact subgroups of\nOut(Fn), and groups generated by powers of independent loxodromic WPD elements\nof a group acting on a Gromov hyperbolic space. We initiate the study of\nintersection and combination properties of A/QI triples. Under the additional\nhypothesis that G is finitely generated, we use a method of Sisto to show that\nH is stable. We apply theorems of Kapovich--Rafi and Dowdall--Taylor to analyze\nthe Gromov boundary of an associated cone-off. We close with some examples and\nquestions.",

Since the\n$A_1$ double affine Hecke algebra is Morita equivalent to its spherical\nsubalgebra, discovering modules for $K_q(T^2 \\setminus D^2)$ immediately\nprovides us with modules for the $A_1$ DAHA.\n  Stated skein theory enhances traditional Kauffman bracket skein theory by\nincorporating the boundary components of manifolds, thereby offering additional\nproperties such as excision that enrich the algebraic structure. Furthermore,\nKauffman bracket skein algebras embed into their stated counterparts, showing\nthat stated skein algebras are extensions of Kauffman bracket skein algebras.\nWe use this extended framework to further develop the representation theory of\nthe $A_1$ DAHA.\n  After identifying generators for the stated skein algebra of $T^2 \\setminus\nD^2$, we embed this algebra into a quantum $6$-torus and leverage the nice\nrepresentation-theoretic properties of quantum tori to construct a module of\nLaurent polynomials.

Global surrogate models that approximate the predictions\nof a black box model (e.g. an artificial or biological neural net) are usually\nused to provide valuable theoretical insights for the model interpretability.\nIn order to evaluate how well a surrogate model can account for the\nrepresentation in another model, we need to develop inference methods for model\ncomparison. Previous studies have compared models and brains in terms of their\nrepresentational geometries (characterized by the matrix of distances between\nrepresentations of the input patterns in a model layer or cortical area). In\nthis study, we propose to explore these summary statistical descriptions of\nrepresentations in models and brains as part of a broader class of statistics\nthat emphasize the topology as well as the geometry of representations. The\ntopological summary statistics build on topological data analysis (TDA) and\nother graph-based methods. We evaluate these statistics in terms of the\nsensitivity and specificity that they afford when used for model selection,\nwith the goal to relate different neural network models to each other and to\nmake inferences about the computational mechanism that might best account for a\nblack box representation.

It analyzes\nhow persistent topological Laplacians and Dirac operators provide spectral\nrepresentations to capture both topological invariants and homotopic evolution.\nOther formulations are presented in terms of sheaf theory, Mayer topology, and\ninteraction topology.

For one-dimensional\n(1D) curves embedded in 3-space, approaches from geometric topology are\ndiscussed, including multiscale Gauss-link integrals, persistent Jones\npolynomials, and persistent Khovanov homology.
