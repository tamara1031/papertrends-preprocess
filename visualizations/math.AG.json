We\nshow that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated\ncategory has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a\nbounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also\nprove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures\non any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its\ncompletion.\n  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately\ngives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes\nanother remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded\n$t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When\nspecialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings,\nconnective $\\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc.,\nwe get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these\nresults not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in\nour sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated\ncategory, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all\nbounded $t$-structures are equivalent.

Indeed,\ndetermining its value for the $2\\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor would\ndetermine the matrix multiplication exponent, a long-standing open problem. On\nthe other hand, Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture makes the bold claim that\nasymptotic tensor rank equals the largest dimension of the tensor and is thus\nas easy to compute as matrix rank. Despite tremendous interest, much is still\nunknown about the structural and computational properties of asymptotic rank;\nfor instance whether it is computable.\n  We prove that asymptotic tensor rank is \"computable from above\", that is, for\nany real number $r$ there is an (efficient) algorithm that determines, given a\ntensor $T$, if the asymptotic tensor rank of $T$ is at most $r$. The algorithm\nhas a simple structure; it consists of evaluating a finite list of polynomials\non the tensor. Indeed, we prove that the sublevel sets of asymptotic rank are\nZariski-closed (just like matrix rank). While we do not exhibit these\npolynomials explicitly, their mere existence has strong implications on the\nstructure of asymptotic rank.\n  As one such implication, we find that the values that asymptotic tensor rank\ntakes, on all tensors, is a well-ordered set. In other words, any\nnon-increasing sequence of asymptotic ranks stabilizes (\"discreteness from\nabove\"). In particular, for the matrix multiplication exponent (which is an\nasymptotic rank) there is no sequence of exponents of bilinear maps that\napproximates it arbitrarily closely from above without being eventually\nconstant. In other words, any upper bound on the matrix multiplication exponent\nthat is close enough, will \"snap\" to it.

In Part 1, we revisit the\ngeneral theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions\nof so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description\nof key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in\nFTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a\n$14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\\mathfrak{U}_{\\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of\ncodimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal\nsingularities, and we construct examples of prime $\\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds\nof No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted\nprojectivization of $\\mathfrak{U}_{\\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective\nspace $\\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation\nbetween $\\mathfrak{U}_{\\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety,\nwhich is a key variety for prime $\\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].",
