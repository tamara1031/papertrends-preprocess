The\ncompany allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders\nwhile strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting\ndividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The\nirreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot\nbe prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate level\nand the reinsurance level are modelled as nondecreasing processes, thereby\nsatisfying the constraints. The incurred claims are modelled via a Brownian\nrisk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected\ndiscounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and\ndividend levels belong to either a finite set or a closed interval. The optimal\nvalue functions for the finite set case and the closed interval case are proved\nto be the unique viscosity solutions of the corresponding\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and the convergence between these optimal\nvalue functions is established. For the finite set case, a threshold strategy\nis proved to be optimal, while for the closed interval case, an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal strategy is constructed.

The problem formulation considered in this paper is closely\nconnected to the optimal portfolio problem in finance, with some crucial\ndistinctions. In particular, the insurance company's surplus is here (as is\nroutinely the case) approximated by a Brownian motion, as opposed to the\ngeometric Brownian motion used to model assets in finance. Furthermore, risk\nexposure is dialled \"down\" via reinsurance, rather than \"up\" via risky\ninvestments. This leads to interesting qualitative differences in the optimal\ndesigns.\n  In this paper, using the martingale method, we derive the optimal design as a\nfunction of proportional, non-cheap reinsurance design that maximises the\nquadratic utility of the terminal value of the insurance surplus.

Traditional credit default prediction methods mostly rely on machine\nlearning models, such as decision trees and random forests, but these methods\nhave certain limitations in processing complex data and capturing potential\nrisk patterns. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on\nthe combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer for\ncredit user default prediction. The model combines the advantages of CNN in\nlocal feature extraction with the ability of Transformer in global dependency\nmodeling, effectively improving the accuracy and robustness of credit default\nprediction. Through experiments on public credit default datasets, the results\nshow that the CNN+Transformer model outperforms traditional machine learning\nmodels, such as random forests and XGBoost, in multiple evaluation indicators\nsuch as accuracy, AUC, and KS value, demonstrating its powerful ability in\ncomplex financial data modeling. Further experimental analysis shows that\nappropriate optimizer selection and learning rate adjustment play a vital role\nin improving model performance. In addition, the ablation experiment of the\nmodel verifies the advantages of the combination of CNN and Transformer and\nproves the complementarity of the two in credit default prediction. This study\nprovides a new idea for credit default prediction and provides strong support\nfor risk assessment and intelligent decision-making in the financial field.\nFuture research can further improve the prediction effect and generalization\nability by introducing more unstructured data and improving the model\narchitecture.",

The steady\nstate of this process is the solution of a linear system governed by the\nexponential of the replication matrix of the process. We provide a bridge\nbetween the numerical stability of this linear system, measured by the\ncondition number in an opportune norm, and the structural predictability of the\nunderlying signed network. The link between the condition number and related\nsystemic risk measures, such as the market rank indicators, allows the global\nbalance index to be interpreted as a new systemic risk measure.

To close this gap, we use a panel regression fixed effects model\nto empirically analyse the cross-version (v2 and v3) and cross-chain (L1 and\nL2) performance of the liquidation mechanisms of the two most popular lending\nprotocols, Aave and Compound, during the period Jan 2021 to Dec 2024. Our\nanalysis reveals that liquidation events in v3 of both protocols lead to an\nincrease in total value locked and total revenue, with stronger impact on the\nL2 blockchain compared to L1. In contrast, liquidations in v2 have an\ninsignificant impact, which indicates that the most recent v3 protocols have\nbetter risk management than the earlier v2 protocols.

In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the\nbenchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold,\nin terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability.

Extending this\nanalysis to DeFi, we identify unique structural and technological\ncharacteristics - such as composability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and\nalgorithm-driven mechanisms - that shape the emergence and transmission of\nrisks within decentralized systems. Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight\nrisks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity\nshocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently\ndue to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability\nin DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how\ndisruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political\ndevelopments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing\ninterdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance\nof understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually,\nbut also at their intersection.

          "abstract": "The IFRS 9 accounting standard requires the prediction of credit\ndeterioration in financial instruments, i.e., significant increases in credit\nrisk (SICR).

We examine the\nshortcomings of this PD-comparison approach and propose an alternative\nframework for generating SICR-definitions based on three parameters:\ndelinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period. Having varied these framework\nparameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit logistic regression\nmodels accordingly using rich South African mortgage and macroeconomic data.\nFor each definition and corresponding model, the resulting SICR-rates are\nanalysed at the portfolio-level on their stability over time and their\nresponsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we compare both the\naccuracy and dynamicity of the SICR-predictions, and discover several\ninteresting trends and trade-offs. These results can help any bank with\nappropriately setting the three framework parameters in defining SICR-events\nfor prediction purposes. We demonstrate this process by comparing the\nbest-performing SICR-model to the PD-comparison approach, and show the latter's\ninferiority as an early-warning system. Our work can therefore guide the\nformulation, modelling, and testing of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting\nthe timeous recognition of credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.",

          "abstract": "In the pursuit of modelling a loan's probability of default (PD) over its\nlifetime, repeat default events are often ignored when using Cox Proportional\nHazard (PH) models. Excluding such events may produce biased and inaccurate\nPD-estimates, which can compromise financial buffers against future losses.\nAccordingly, we investigate a few subtypes of Cox-models that can incorporate\nrecurrent default events. Using South African mortgage data, we explore both\nthe Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time\nmodels. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores\nrecurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model. Models are\nevaluated using Harrell's c-statistic, adjusted Cox-Sell residuals, and a novel\nextension of time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\nFrom these Cox-models, we demonstrate how to derive a portfolio-level\nterm-structure of default risk, which is a series of marginal PD-estimates at\neach point of the average loan's lifetime. While the TFD- and PWP-models do not\ndiffer significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed\nexpectations. Depending on the prevalence of recurrent defaults, one may\ntherefore safely ignore them when estimating lifetime default risk.\nAccordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in\nproducing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.",
