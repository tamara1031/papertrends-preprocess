          "abstract": "The application machine learning (ML) algorithms to turbulence modeling has\nshown promise over the last few years, but their application has been\nrestricted to eddy viscosity based closure approaches. In this article we\ndiscuss rationale for the application of machine learning with high-fidelity\nturbulence data to develop models at the level of Reynolds stress transport\nmodeling. Based on these rationale we compare different machine learning\nalgorithms to determine their efficacy and robustness at modeling the different\ntransport processes in the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations. Those data\ndriven algorithms include Random forests, gradient boosted trees and neural\nnetworks. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for flow in channels is\nused both as training and testing of the ML models. The optimal\nhyper-parameters of the ML algorithms are determined using Bayesian\noptimization. The efficacy of above mentioned algorithms is assessed in the\nmodeling and prediction of the terms in the Reynolds stress transport\nequations. It was observed that all the three algorithms predict the turbulence\nparameters with acceptable level of accuracy. These ML models are then applied\nfor prediction of the pressure strain correlation of flow cases that are\ndifferent from the flows used for training, to assess their robustness and\ngeneralizability. This explores the assertion that ML based data driven\nturbulence models can overcome the modeling limitations associated with the\ntraditional turbulence models and ML models trained with large amounts data\nwith different classes of flows can predict flow field with reasonable accuracy\nfor unknown flows with similar flow physics. In addition to this verification\nwe carry out validation for the final ML models by assessing the importance of\ndifferent input features for prediction.",

Although these\nmethods are proven successful for many applications, there is a grand challenge\nof improving their generalizability. This is particularly essential when\ndata-driven models are employed within outer-loop applications like\noptimization. In this work, we put forth a physics-guided machine learning\n(PGML) framework that leverages the interpretable physics-based model with a\ndeep learning model. The PGML framework is capable of enhancing the\ngeneralizability of data-driven models and effectively protect against or\ninform about the inaccurate predictions resulting from extrapolation. We apply\nthe PGML framework as a novel model fusion approach combining the physics-based\nGalerkin projection model and long-short term memory (LSTM) network for\nparametric model order reduction of fluid flows. We demonstrate the improved\ngeneralizability of the PGML framework against a purely data-driven approach\nthrough the injection of physics features into intermediate LSTM layers. Our\nquantitative analysis shows that the overall model uncertainty can be reduced\nthrough the PGML approach especially for test data coming from a distribution\ndifferent than the training data. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach\ncan be used as an inverse diagnostic tool providing a confidence score\nassociated with models and observations. The proposed framework also allows for\nmulti-fidelity computing by making use of low-fidelity models in the online\ndeployment of quantified data-driven models.",

          "year": "2021-10",
          "abstract": "Recently, computational modeling has shifted towards the use of deep\nlearning, and other data-driven modeling frameworks. Although this shift in\nmodeling holds promise in many applications like design optimization and\nreal-time control by lowering the computational burden, training deep learning\nmodels needs a huge amount of data. This big data is not always available for\nscientific problems and leads to poorly generalizable data-driven models. This\ngap can be furnished by leveraging information from physics-based models.\nExploiting prior knowledge about the problem at hand, this study puts forth a\nconcatenated neural network approach to build more tailored, effective, and\nefficient machine learning models. For our analysis, without losing its\ngeneralizability and modularity, we focus on the development of predictive\nmodels for laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows. In particular, we\ncombine the self-similarity solution and power-law velocity profile\n(low-fidelity models) with the noisy data obtained either from experiments or\ncomputational fluid dynamics simulations (high-fidelity models) through a\nconcatenated neural network. We illustrate how the knowledge from these\nsimplified models results in reducing uncertainties associated with deep\nlearning models. The proposed framework produces physically consistent models\nthat attempt to achieve better generalization than data-driven models obtained\npurely based on data. While we demonstrate our framework for a problem relevant\nto fluid mechanics, its workflow and principles can be adopted for many\nscientific problems where empirical models are prevalent. In line with grand\ndemands in novel physics-guided machine learning principles, this work builds a\nbridge between extensive physics-based theories and data-driven modeling\nparadigms and paves the way for using hybrid modeling approaches for\nnext-generation digital twin technologies.",

We find that depending on its\nstrength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be\nsubstantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong\ntidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large\ntidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial\nmagnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can\ninhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell\nstresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and\ncharacterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\\'en\nwaves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is\nclose to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of\nPm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars,\nsuch that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic\nfields.",

Relevant flame\nproperties are averaged normal to the zero-curvature isotherm regions to obtain\nthe conditional mean flame structures. In the smallest $Le$ case, downstream of\nthe most probable zero-curvature regions, the temperature exceeds that of the\nstandard laminar flame, leading to enhanced local thermal gradient and flame\nspeed. This is due to increased heat-release rate contribution by differential\ndiffusion in positive curvatures downstream of the zero-curvature locations.\nFurthermore, locally, the flame structure is broadened for all cases due to a\nreversal in the direction of the flame speed gradient. This reversal is caused\nby cylindrical flame-flame interactions upstream of the zero-curvature regions,\nresulting in localized scalar mixing within the flame structure.

The mean streamwise velocity\nprofiles exhibit a shortened logarithmic region and a longer wake region\ncompared with planar boundary layers at zero pressure gradient. With the\nembedded-shear-layer scaling, self-similarity is observed for the mean velocity\nand all three components of turbulence intensity. The azimuthal-wavenumber\nspectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations possess two peaks in the\nwall-normal direction, an inner peak at the wavelength of approximately 100\nwall units and an outer peak in the wake region with growing strength,\nwavelength and distance to the wall in the downstream direction. Two-point\ncorrelations of streamwise velocity fluctuations show significant downstream\ngrowth and elongation of turbulence structures with increasing inclination\nangle. However, relative to the boundary-layer thickness, the correlation\nstructures decrease in size in the downstream direction. The distributions of\nstreamwise and wall-normal integral lengths across the boundary-layer thickness\nresemble those of zero-pressure-gradient planar boundary layers, whereas the\nazimuthal integral length deviates from the planar boundary-layer behavior at\ndownstream stations.",

          "abstract": "In the COVID-19 pandemic, billions are wearing face masks, in both health\ncare settings and in public. Which type of mask we should wear in what\nsituation, is therefore important. There are three basic types: cotton,\nsurgical, and respirators (e.g. FFP2, N95 and similar). All are essentially air\nfilters worn on the face. Air filtration is relatively well understood,\nhowever, we have almost no direct evidence on the relative role played by\naerosol particles of differing sizes in disease transmission. But if the virus\nconcentration is assumed independent of aerosol particle size, then most virus\nwill be in particles > 1 $\\mu$m. We develop a model that predicts surgical\nmasks are effective at reducing the risk of airborne transmission because the\nfiltering material most surgical masks use is highly effective at filtering\nparticles with diameters > 1 $\\mu$m. However, surgical masks are significantly\nless effective than masks of FFP2, N95 and similar standards, mostly due to the\npoor fit of surgical masks. Earlier work found that ~30% of the air bypasses a\nsurgical mask and is not filtered. This highlights the fact that standards for\nsurgical masks do not specify how well the mask should fit, and so are not\nadequate for protection against COVID-19.",

          "abstract": "The ongoing respiratory COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the social and\nprivate lives of the majority of the global population. This infection is\nprimarily transmitted via virus-laden fluid particles (i.e., droplets and\naerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected individuals and\nexpelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and\nsneezing. To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the\nworld, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers. It is\nplausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face masks, face\nshields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing\nface covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer\nheat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in\ngyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and\nneed to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by\nthe fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward\nand outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen.\nApplying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material\nbased protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air\nacross the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging\nvirus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a\nconsequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study,\nshows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide\nboth inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus\ninfection like COVID-19.",

Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced by the\nlevel and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the\nblood flow in the left ventricle of the heart through a computational model\nconstructed from patient-specific data. The blood flow in the ventricle is\nmodeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the mitral valve\nby a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A\nfinite element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation\nof the velocity and pressure of the blood flow is constructed. A triple\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then used to distinguish\nbetween rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear\nflow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally\ndifferent flow structures, each generating a distinct type of mechanical\nstimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare the results to simulations\nwhere a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a\nsignificant modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear\nin the simulation cases treated with clips increased more compared to the\nuntreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease in valve opening\narea of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain,\nbut a 150 % increase in shear.

In this paper, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) agent has been employed to train an artificial\nneural network (ANN) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data to perform\nactive flow control (AFC) around a 2-D circular cylinder. Flow control\nstrategies are investigated at a diameter-based Reynolds number Re_D = 100\nusing advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm by means of two symmetric plasma\nactuators located on the surface of the cylinder near the separation point. The\nDRL agent interacts with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment\nthrough manipulating the non-dimensional burst frequency (f^+) of the two\nplasma actuators, and the time-averaged surface pressure is used as a feedback\nobservation to the deep neural networks (DNNs). The results show that a regular\nactuation using a constant non-dimensional burst frequency gives a maximum drag\nreduction of 21.8 %, while the DRL agent is able to learn a control strategy\nthat achieves a drag reduction of 22.6%. By analyzing the flow-field, it is\nshown that the drag reduction is accompanied with a strong flow reattachment\nand a significant reduction in the mean velocity magnitude and velocity\nfluctuations at the wake region.

The present theoretical model effectively captures the\nexperimental results for bubbles generated in free fields, near free surfaces,\nadjacent to rigid walls, and in the vicinity of other bubbles.
