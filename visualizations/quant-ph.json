For this purpose, one can assume the quantum\ndescription of devices and use available information to strengthen the bound\nfor separable states, which may go beyond the local bound, enabling more\nefficient entanglement detection. Here we present a systematic approach for\nstrengthening Bell inequalities for qubit systems, using Mermin-Klyshko-Bell\ninequalities as examples, by considering measurement devices that are coarsely\ncalibrated only by their ability to generate nonlocal correlations without\nrequiring precise quantum characterization. In the case of bipartite and\ntripartite systems, we derive trade-offs between upper bounds for separable\nstates and general states in terms of structure functions to optimize the\nentanglement detection. We then strengthen n-partite Bell inequalities for the\ndetection of states exhibiting a diversity of entanglement structures such as\ngenuine multipartite entanglement. For general Bell scenarios with some\nmeasurements characterized, we demonstrate that entanglement can also be\ndetected with some local correlations by exploiting the\nNavascu\\'es-Pironio-Ac\\'in hierarchy of tests.",

In practice, however, all communication links\nare affected by noise from the environment. Here we investigate the ability of\nquantum channels to perform quantum communication tasks by restricting the\nparticipants to use only local operations and one-way classical communication\n(one-way LOCC) along with the available quantum channel. In particular, a\nchannel can be used to distill a highly entangled state between two parties,\nwhich further enables quantum or private communication. In this work, we invoke\nthe framework of superchannels to study the distillation of a resourceful\nquantum state, such as a maximally entangled state or a private state, using\nmultiple instances of a point-to-point quantum channel. We use the idea of\n$k$-extendibility to obtain a semidefinite relaxation of the set of one-way\nLOCC superchannels and define a class of entanglement measures for quantum\nchannels that decrease monotonically under such superchannels; therefore these\nmeasures, dubbed collectively the ``unextendible entanglement of a channel'',\nyield upper bounds on several communication-theoretic quantities of interest in\nthe regimes of resource distillation and zero error. We then generalize the\nformalism of $k$-extendibility to bipartite superchannels, thus obtaining\nfunctions that are monotone under two-extendible superchannels. This allows us\nto analyze probabilistic distillation of ebits or secret key bits from a\nbipartite state when using a resourceful quantum channel. Moreover, we propose\nsemidefinite programs to evaluate several of these quantities, providing a\ncomputationally feasible method of comparison between quantum channels for\nresource distillation.",

          "abstract": "Recent theoretical work has shown that the competition between coherent\nunitary dynamics and stochastic measurements, performed by the environment,\nalong wavefunction trajectories can give rise to transitions in the\nentanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we\nanalyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is\nreversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled\nphase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain, while competing single-particle or\ninteracting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the\nsingle-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an\nentanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the\ncompetition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics\nincreases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent\nobservables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state\ndynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative\ndynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian\ncontribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In\naddition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the\nentanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition.\nComplementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent\ndynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the\nentanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results suggest\nthat this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians,\nunderlining its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.",

The theory is applied to quantum many-body\nscars, continuous, discrete and dissipative time crystals, Hilbert space\nfragmentation, lattice gauge theories, and disorder-free localization, among\nother cases. Novel pseudolocal classes of operators are introduced in the\nprocess: projected-local, which are local only for some states, crypto-local,\nwhose locality is not manifest in terms of any finite number of local densities\nand transient ones, that dictate finite-time relaxation dynamics.

We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically\ndisplays the $\\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre\nensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau\nbehaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in\nthe presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a\ntime scale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size\nfor sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian\nanalogue of the $\\textit{many-body Thouless time}$.

To date, no\nquantum computer has simulated a molecule of a size and complexity relevant to\nreal-world applications, despite the fact that the variational quantum\neigensolver (VQE) algorithm can predict chemically accurate total energies.\nNevertheless, because of the many applications of moderately-sized, strongly\ncorrelated systems, such as molecular catalysts, the successful use of the VQE\nstands as an important waypoint in the advancement toward useful chemical\nmodeling on near-term quantum processors. In this paper, we take a significant\nstep in this direction. We lay out the steps, write, and run parallel code for\nan (emulated) quantum computer to compute the bond dissociation curves of the\nTiH, LiH, NaH, and KH diatomic hydride molecules using VQE. TiH was chosen as a\nrelatively simple chemical system that incorporates d orbitals and strong\nelectron correlation. Because current VQE implementations on existing quantum\nhardware are limited by qubit error rates, the number of qubits available, and\nthe allowable gate depth, recent studies have focused on chemical systems\ninvolving s and p block elements. Through VQE + UCCSD calculations of TiH, we\nevaluate the near-term feasibility of modeling a molecule with d-orbitals on\nreal quantum hardware. We demonstrate that the inclusion of d-orbitals and the\nuse of the UCCSD ansatz, which are both necessary to capture the correct TiH\nphysics, dramatically increase the cost of this problem.

Recently we have considered in (Phys. Rev.\nA. {\\bf 101}, 02232 (2020)) the problem: what functions can be computed by an\nexact one-query quantum algorithm? This problem has been addressed for total\nBoolean functions but still open for partial Boolean functions.

By these conditions, we construct some new functions\nthat can be computed exactly by one-query quantum algorithms but have essential\ndifference from the already known ones.

While earlier studies analyzed the optimal\nperformance of this engine when the working body could be transformed by any\narbitrary thermal operation, we present closed expressions for the maximum work\nproduced by the engine and the maximum efficiency of the engine when only a\nrestricted class of thermal operations can be implemented on the working body.\nFurthermore, we explore the engine's optimal performance under two well-studied\nclasses of restrictions: thermal operations realized via Jaynes-Cummings\ninteraction and thermal operations realizable with finite-sized heat baths.\nTherefore, on one hand, our results are general, as they reproduce the optimal\nperformance achieved when any arbitrary thermal operation can be implemented on\nthe working body once the restriction is relaxed. On the other hand, our\nresults allow us to determine the engine's maximum work production and\nefficiency in a more realistic scenario, where only a restricted class of\nthermal operations are possible, thereby bringing our findings closer to\nexperimental feasibility.",
