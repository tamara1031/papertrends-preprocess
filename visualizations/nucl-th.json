          "abstract": "Background: Magnetic quadrupole (M2) excitation represents a fundamental\nfeature in atomic nucleus associated to nuclear magnetism induced by spin and\norbital transition operator. So far it has only been investigated within the\nnon-relativistic theoretical approaches, and available experimental data are\nrather limited. Purpose: We aim to investigate the properties of M2 transitions\nin closed and open-shell nuclei using the framework of relativistic nuclear\nenergy density functional. The calculated M2 transition strengths could be used\nto constrain the quenching of the spin gyromagnetic factors. Methods: The M2\nexcitations are described using the relativistic quasiparticle random phase\napproximation (RQRPA) with the residual interaction extended with the\nisovector-pseudovector term. Results: The M2 transition strength distributions\nare described and analyzed for closed and open shell nuclei. The results are\ncompared with available experimental data and the strength missing from the\nexperiment is discussed. The evolution of M2 transition properties has been\ninvestigated within the $^{36-64} \\rm Ca$ isotope chain. Conclusion: The main\nM2 transitions have rather rich underlying structure and their collectivity\nincreases with the mass number due to larger number of contributing\nparticle-hole configurations. Pairing correlations in open shell nuclei have\nstrong effect, causing the M2 strength reduction and shifting of the centroid\nenergies to higher values. The analysis of M2 transition strengths indicate\nthat considerable amount of experimental strength may be missing, mainly due to\nlimitations to rather restricted energy ranges. The calculated M2 strengths for\nCa isotopes, together with the future experimental data will allow constraining\nthe quenching of the $g$ factors in nuclear medium.",

In\naddition, we explore the sensitivity of the calculated cross section to\ndifferent nuclear structure models. Methods: The excitation energy spectrum and\nthe differential cross-section angular distributions are measured using the\nMAGNEX large acceptance magnetic spectrometer for the detection of the\nejectiles and the missing mass technique for the reconstruction of the reaction\nkinematics. The data are compared with calculations based on distorted-wave\nBorn approximation, coupled-channels Born approximation, and coupled reaction\nchannels adopting spectroscopic amplitudes for the projectile and target\noverlaps derived by large-scale shell-model calculations and interacting\nboson-fermion model. Results: Peaks in the energy spectra corresponding to\ngroups of unresolved transitions to 77Se and 17O are identified. The\nexperimental cross sections are extracted and compared to theoretical\ncalculations. A remarkable agreement is found, without using any scaling\nfactors, demonstrating that the adopted models for nuclear structure and\nreaction take into account the relevant aspects of the studied processes.

          "abstract": "We study the electrodisintegration of deuteron at quasi-elastic kinematics\nand high transferred momentum as a probe for the short distance structure in\nnuclei. In this reaction, an electron hits a nucleus of deuterium, which breaks\nup into a proton-neutron pair. We focus our attention on events where fast\nnucleons emerge, corresponding to nuclear configurations where the bound\nnucleons have a high relative momentum (exceeding 700 MeV/c). The present\nresearch is relevant to physical systems where high-density nuclear matter is\npresent. This condition covers a wide range of physics, from neutron stars to\nnuclei stability and the repulsive nuclear core.\n  The present work differs from previous studies in two crucial features. One\nis the definition of the deuteron wave function, which include terms of a\nrelativistic origin that can be ordered based on their relative contribution to\nthe deuteron's internal momentum distribution. These terms, related to the\noff-shell properties of the nucleon-nucleon bound-state, do not occur in\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics. However, they become increasingly important\nin describing configurations with a high nucleon-nucleon relative momentum. The\nsecond difference is that we account for the off-shell nature of the bound\nnucleon that enters on the definition of the (half-off-shell) electromagnetic\ncurrent. We avoid many of the difficulties inherent to the relativistic nature\nof the processes involved by adopting a theoretical framework known as Light\nFront dynamics. Simultaneous simplifications in the definition of the\nrelativistic wave function for the proton-neutron bound state and the treatment\nof the (half-off-shell) electromagnetic current for the bound nucleon are among\nthe essential advantages resulting from the use of the Light Front dynamics.",
