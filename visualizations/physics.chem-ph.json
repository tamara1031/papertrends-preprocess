          "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive capability in\nhandling molecular science tasks. To support various molecular properties at\nscale, machine learning models are trained in the multi-task learning paradigm.\nNevertheless, data of different molecular properties are often not aligned:\nsome quantities, e.g. equilibrium structure, demand more cost to compute than\nothers, e.g. energy, so their data are often generated by cheaper computational\nmethods at the cost of lower accuracy, which cannot be directly overcome\nthrough multi-task learning. Moreover, it is not straightforward to leverage\nabundant data of other tasks to benefit a particular task. To handle such data\nheterogeneity challenges, we exploit the specialty of molecular tasks that\nthere are physical laws connecting them, and design consistency training\napproaches that allow different tasks to exchange information directly so as to\nimprove one another. Particularly, we demonstrate that the more accurate energy\ndata can improve the accuracy of structure prediction. We also find that\nconsistency training can directly leverage force and off-equilibrium structure\ndata to improve structure prediction, demonstrating a broad capability for\nintegrating heterogeneous data.",

Beginning with a single molecule coupled to a single cavity mode,\nwe show that the cavity indeed enforces hydrogen transfer from an enol to an\nenethiol configuration with transfer rates significantly increasing with\nlight-matter interaction strength. This positive effect of the cavity on\nreaction rates is different from several other systems studied so far, where a\nretarding effect of the cavity on rates was found. It is argued that the cavity\n``catalyzes'' the reaction by transfer of virtual photons to the molecule. The\nsame concept applies to ensembles with up to $N=20$ TAA molecules coupled to a\nsingle cavity mode, where an additional, significant, ensemble-induced\ncollective isomerization rate enhancement is found.

Under\nweak laser irradiation and when the single-molecule light-matter coupling can\nbe neglected (often in the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode\nis large), we show that the excited-state molecular dynamics under collective\nstrong coupling can be exactly replicated without the cavity using a shaped (or\n``filtered'') laser, whose field amplitude is enhanced by the cavity quality\nfactor, shining on the bare molecules. As a consequence, the absorption within\na cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission\nand the bare molecular absorption, suggesting that polaritons act in part as\noptical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward\nexplanation for a large class of experiments and theoretical models in\nmolecular polaritonics, highlighting that the same effects can be achieved\nwithout the cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this\nsimple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent\nnonlinear response of polaritonic systems. This review establishes a clear\ndistinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through\nclassical linear optics and those that require a quantum electrodynamics\napproach. It also highlights the need to differentiate between effects that\nnecessitate polaritons (i.e., hybrid light-matter states) and those that can\noccur in the weak coupling regime.

However, few modeling work was reported on studying the calendar\ncapacity loss of NMC-graphite Li-ion batteries. In this work, an\nelectrochemical model for NMC-graphite Li-ion battery was developed to\ninvestigate its calendar loss behavior. Various factors affecting the calendar\nloss of the NMC-graphite batteries were systematically investigated, with the\nresults validated with experimental data of a Sanyo 18,650 cylindrical cell. It\nwas found that at 25 o C working temperature and 100% SOC, the capacity drops\n6.4% of its original capacity after 10 months. Also, when the anode particle\nsize decreases from 26.2 {\\mu}m to 6.55 {\\mu}m, the capacity drop ratio is over\n22% after 10 months under the same operation condition. Our simulation results\ndemonstrate that a smaller SOC, a lower cell working temperature and a larger\nparticle size could prolong the battery life during the storage period.

          "abstract": "Externally applied pressure impacts the performance of batteries particularly\nin those undergoing large volume changes, such as lithium metal batteries. In\nparticular, the Li$^+$ electroplating process in large format pouch cells\noccurs at a larger dimension compared to those in smaller lab-scale cells. A\nfundamental linkage between external pressure and large format electroplating\nof Li$^+$ remains missing but yet critically needed to understand the\nelectrochemical behavior of Li$^+$ in practical batteries. Herein, this work\nutilizes 350 Wh/kg lithium metal pouch cell as a model system to study the\nelectroplating of Li$^+$ ions and the impact of external pressure. The\nvertically applied uniaxial pressure on the batteries using liquid electrolyte\nprofoundly affects the electroplating process of Li$^+$ which is well reflected\nby the self-generated pressures in the cell and can be correlated to battery\ncycling stability. Taking advantage of both constant gap and pressure\napplication, all Li metal pouch cells demonstrated minimum swelling of 6-8%\nafter 300 cycles, comparable to that of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries.\nAlong the horizontal directions, the pressure distributed across the surface of\nLi metal pouch cell reveals a unique phenomenon of Li$^+$ migration during the\nelectroplating (charge) process driven by an uneven distribution of external\npressure across the large electrode area, leading to a preferred Li plating in\nthe center area of Li metal anode. This work addresses a longstanding question\nand provides new fundamental insights on large format electrochemical plating\nof Li which will inspire more innovations and lead to homogeneous deposition of\nLi to advance rechargeable lithium metal battery technology.",

          "abstract": "The existence of passivating layers at the interfaces is a major factor\nenabling modern lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Their properties determine the\ncycle life, performance, and safety of batteries. A special case is the solid\nelectrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component film formed due\nto the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte at the\nsurface of the anode. The SEI acts as a passivating layer that hinders further\nelectrolyte disintegration, which is detrimental to the Coulombic efficiency.\nIn this work, we use first-principles simulations to investigate the kinetic\nand electronic properties of the interface between lithium fluoride (LiF) and\nlithium carbonate (Li$_2$CO$_3$), two common SEI components present in Li-ion\nbatteries with organic liquid electrolytes. We find a coherent interface\nbetween these components that restricts the strain in each of them to below 3%.\nWe find that the interface causes a large increase in the formation energy of\nthe Frenkel defect, generating Li vacancies in LiF and Li interstitials in\nLi$_2$CO$_3$ responsible for transport. On the other hand, the Li interstitial\nhopping barrier is reduced from $0.3$ eV in bulk Li$_2$CO$_3$ to $0.10$ or\n$0.22$ eV in the interfacial structure considered, demonstrating the favorable\nrole of the interface. Controlling these two effects in a heterogeneous SEI is\ncrucial for maintaining fast ion transport in the SEI. We further perform\nCar-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations to explore Li ion conduction in\nour interfacial structure, which reveal an enhanced Li ion diffusion in the\nvicinity of the interface. Understanding the interfacial properties of the\nmultiphase SEI represents an important frontier to enable next-generation\nbatteries.",

In response, by employing a high-precision terahertz\nspectrometer, we have measured and characterized the terahertz dielectric\nresponse of water from supercooled liquid to near the boiling point to explore\nthe motions. The response reveals dynamic relaxation processes corresponding to\nthe collective orientation, single-molecule rotation, and structural\nrearrangements resulting from breaking and reforming hydrogen bonds in water.\nWe have observed the direct relationship between the macroscopic and\nmicroscopic relaxation dynamics of water, and the results have provided\nevidence of two liquid forms in water with different transition temperatures\nand thermal activation energies.

In ZULF NMR, the measurement\nof spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive\nmeans for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting\nsample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong\nexternal magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear\nspin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up\nnew capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to\nthe preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging.\nFurthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio\nband, the nuclear spins can be manipulated with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and\nhighly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to\nhigh-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive\nmaterials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not lead to resonance\nline broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible.

This paper proposes a\nmachine learning approach to learn the HyChem models that can cover both\nhigh-temperature and low-temperature regimes. Specifically, we develop a HyChem\nmodel using the experimental datasets of ignition delay times covering a wide\nrange of temperatures and equivalence ratios.

The results show that the SGD approach can\nachieve comparable model performance with genetic algorithms but the\ncomputational cost is reduced by 1000 times. In addition, with regularization\nin SGD, the SGD approach changes the kinetic parameters from their original\nvalues much less than genetic algorithm and is thus more likely to retrain\nmechanistic meanings.
