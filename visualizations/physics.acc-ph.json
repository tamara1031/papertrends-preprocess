We present a way to\novercome this limit within a single plasma stage. The amplitude of the\nwakefield behind a train of laser pulses can be controlled in-flight by\nmodulating the density profile. This creates a succession of resonant\nlaser-plasma accelerator sections and non-resonant drift sections, within which\nthe wakefield disappears and the electrons rephase. A two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulation with four 2.5TW laser pulses produces a 50MeV\nelectron energy gain, four times that obtained from a uniform plasma. Although\nlaser red-shift prevents operation in the blowout regime, the technique offers\nincreased energy gain for accelerators limited to the linear regime by the\navailable laser power. This is particularly relevant for laser-plasma x-ray\nsources capable of operating at high repetition rates, which are highly sought\nafter.",

Here, we report on\nthe first experimental demonstration of plasma density downramp injection in an\nelectron-driven plasma wakefield accelerator, which can be controlled and tuned\nin all-optical fashion by mJ-level laser pulses. The laser pulse is directed\nacross the path of the plasma wave before its arrival, where it generates a\nlocal plasma density spike in addition to the background plasma by tunnelling\nionization of a high ionization threshold gas component. This density spike\ndistorts the plasma wave during the density downramp, causing plasma electrons\nto be injected into the plasma wave. By tuning the laser pulse energy and\nshape, highly flexible plasma density spike profiles can be designed, enabling\ndark current free, versatile production of high-quality electron beams.

Under proper conditions, electrons from the\nbackground plasma are trapped in the plasma wave and accelerated to\nultra-relativistic velocities. We present recent results from a\nproof-of-principle wakefield acceleration experiment that reveal a unique\nsynergy between a laser-driven and particle-driven accelerator: a high-charge\nlaser-wakefield accelerated electron bunch can drive its own wakefield while\nsimultaneously drawing energy from the laser pulse via direct laser\nacceleration. This process continues to accelerate electrons beyond the usual\ndecelerating phase of the wakefield, thus reaching much higher energies. We\nfind that the 10-centimeter-long nanoparticle-assisted wakefield accelerator\ncan generate 340 pC, 10.4+-0.6 GeV electron bunches with 3.4 GeV RMS convolved\nenergy spread and 0.9 mrad RMS divergence. It can also produce bunches with\nlower energy, a few percent energy spread, and a higher charge.

This paper reports the\nfirst results from a THz source, that is based on a single-pass high-gain THz\nFEL operating with a central wavelength of 100 micrometers. The THz FEL\nprototype is currently in operation at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY\nin Zeuthen (PITZ) and uses the same type of electron source as the European\nXFEL photo injector. A self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL was\nenvisioned as the main mechanism for generating the THz pulses. Although the\nTHz FEL at PITZ is supposed to use the same mechanism as at X-ray facilities,\nit cannot be considered as a simple scaling of the radiation wavelength because\nthere is a large difference in the number of electrons per radiation\nwavelength, which is five orders of magnitude higher for the THz case. The\nbunching factor arising from the electron beam current profile contributes\nstrongly to the initial spontaneous emission starting the FEL process.\nProof-of-principle experiments were done at PITZ using an LCLS-I undulator to\ngenerate the first high-power, high-repetition-rate single-pass THz FEL\nradiation. Electron bunches with a beam energy of ~17 MeV and a bunch charge of\nup to several nC are used to generate THz pulses with a pulse energy of several\ntens of microjoules. For example, for an electron beam with a charge of ~2.4\nnC, more than 100 microjoules were generated at a central wavelength of 100\nmicrometers. The narrowband spectrum was also demonstrated by spectral\nmeasurements. These proof-of-principle experiments pave the way for a tunable,\nhigh-repetition-rate THz source providing pulses with energies in the\nmillijoule range.",

A possible use of conduction-cooled SRF linacs is for\nenvironmental applications, requiring electron beams with energy of $1 - 10$\nMeV and 1 MW of power.

The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with\nfrequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor\nas a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is\nsimilar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher\ntemperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing.

Application of this formalism allows\nto calculate single particle's trajectories in linear approximation.
