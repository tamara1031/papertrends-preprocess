          "abstract": "We present a novel scenario, in which light ($\\sim$ few \\rm{eV}) dark\nfermions (sterile neutrinos) interact with a scalar field like in mass varying\nneutrino dark energy theories. As the $\\rm{eV}$ sterile states naturally become\nnon-relativistic before the Matter Radiation Equality (MRE), we show that the\nneutrino-scalar fluid develops strong perturbative instability followed by the\nformation of neutrino-nuggets and the early dark energy behaviour disappears\naround MRE. The stability of the nugget is achieved when the Fermi pressure\nbalances the attractive scalar force and we numerically find the mass and\nradius of heavy cold nuggets by solving for the static configuration for the\nscalar field. We find that for the case when DM nugget density is sub-dominant\nand most of the early DE energy goes into scalar field dynamics, it can in\nprinciple relax the Hubble anomaly. Especially when a kinetic energy dominated\nphase appears after the phase transition, the DE density dilutes faster than\nradiation and satisfy the requirements for solving $H_0$ anomaly. In our\nscenario, unlike in originally proposed early dark energy theory, the dark\nenergy density is controlled by ($\\rm{eV}$) neutrino mass and it does not\nrequire a fine tuned EDE scale. We perform a MCMC analysis and confront our\nmodel with Planck + SHOES and BAO data and find an evidence for non-zero\nneutrino-scalar EDE density during MRE. Our analysis shows that this model is\nin agreement of nearly 1.3$\\sigma$ with SHOES measurement which is $H_0 = 74.03\n\\pm 1.42$ km/s/Mpc.",

We include the\nperturbation of the Hubble rate in the interaction term, which was absent in\nprevious works. We also consider more recent data sets such as cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropies from \\text{Planck} 2018, type I-a supernovae\n(SNIa) measurements from Pantheon+ and data from baryon acoustic oscillations\n(BAO), and redshift space distortions (RSD). One of the models presents a\nstrong incompatibility when different cosmological datasets are used. We\nanalyze the influence of the SH0ES Cepheid host distances on the results and,\nalthough for one model the discrepancy of $H_0$ is reduced to $3.2\\sigma$ when\ncompared to the value obtained by the \\textit{Planck} collaboration and\n$3.6\\sigma$ when compared to the SH0ES team, joint analysis is incompatible.\nIncluding BAO with RSD shows incompatibility with SH0ES for all models\nconsidered here. We perform a model comparison and although there is a\npreference for interacting dark energy over $\\Lambda$CDM for all the models for\njoint analysis CMB+BAO+RSD+SNIa, most of the 2D contours do not overlap. We\nconclude that the models of interactions in the dark sector considered in this\npaper are not flexible enough to fit all the cosmological data including values\nof $H_0$ from SH0ES in a statistically acceptable way. Therefore, the addition\nof one extra degree of freedom (i.e. the coupling between dark matter and dark\nmatter) does not help enough to alleviate the already existing tension in the\nvanilla $\\Lambda$CDM, suggesting that the models would need to be modified to\ninclude further flexibility of predictions to help elucidate this issue.",

However, measurements from the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reports a $> 2.5\\sigma$ preference for\ndynamical dark energy, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data favoring a\ntime varying equation of state $w(z)$ over the cosmological constant ($w=-1$).\nWe present the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, where dark energy originates from\nthe lightest meson field $\\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge sector, emerging\ndynamically via non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse-power-law\npotential $V(\\phi)=\\Lambda_{c}^{4 + 2/3}\\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE has no free\nparameters, one less than $\\Lambda$CDM and three less than $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM\nmodels.

          "abstract": "The marked power spectrum - a two-point correlation function of a transformed\ndensity field - has emerged as a promising tool for extracting cosmological\ninformation from the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we\npresent the first comprehensive analytical study of the marked power spectrum's\nsensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) of the non-local type. We\nextend previous effective field theory frameworks to incorporate PNG,\ndeveloping a complete theoretical model that we validate against the Quijote\nsimulation suite. Through a systematic Fisher analysis, we compare the\nconstraining power of the marked power spectrum against traditional approaches\ncombining the power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We explore different choices\nof mark parameters to evaluate their impact on parameter constraints,\nparticularly focusing on equilateral and orthogonal PNG as well as neutrino\nmasses. Our analysis shows that while marking up underdense regions yields\noptimal constraints in the low shot-noise regime, the marked power spectrum's\nperformance for discrete tracers with BOSS-like number densities does not\nsurpass that of P+B analysis at mildly non-linear scales ($k \\lesssim 0.25\n\\,h/\\text{Mpc}$). However, the marked approach offers several practical\nadvantages, including simpler estimation procedures and potentially more\nmanageable systematic effects. Our theoretical framework reveals how the marked\npower spectrum incorporates higher-order correlation information through terms\nresembling tree-level bispectra and power spectrum convolutions.

          "abstract": "We investigate the accuracy of the perturbative galaxy bias expansion in view\nof the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy samples. We\ncompare the performance of an Eulerian galaxy bias expansion, using\nstate-of-art prescriptions from the effective field theory of large-scale\nstructure (EFTofLSS), against a hybrid approach based on Lagrangian\nperturbation theory and high-resolution simulations. These models are\nbenchmarked against comoving snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulation at\n$z=(0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8)$, which have been populated with H$\\alpha$ galaxies\nleading to catalogues of millions of objects within a volume of about\n$58\\,h^{-3}\\,{\\rm Gpc}^3$. Our analysis suggests that both models can be used\nto provide a robust inference of the parameters $(h, \\omega_{\\rm c})$ in the\nredshift range under consideration, with comparable constraining power. We\nadditionally determine the range of validity of the EFTofLSS model in terms of\nscale cuts and model degrees of freedom. From these tests, it emerges that the\nstandard third-order Eulerian bias expansion can accurately describe the full\nshape of the real-space galaxy power spectrum up to the maximum wavenumber\n$k_{\\rm max}=0.45\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, even with a measurement precision well\nbelow the percent level. In particular, this is true for a configuration with\nsix free nuisance parameters, including local and non-local bias parameters, a\nmatter counterterm, and a correction to the shot-noise contribution. Fixing\neither tidal bias parameters to physically-motivated relations still leads to\nunbiased cosmological constraints. We finally repeat our analysis assuming a\nvolume that matches the expected footprint of Euclid, but without considering\nobservational effects, as purity and completeness, showing that we can get\nconsistent cosmological constraints over this range of scales and redshifts.",

          "abstract": "An accurate theoretical template of the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum,\nif applicable out to nonlinear scales, enables us to extract more stringent and\nrobust constraints on cosmological parameters from the measured galaxy\nclustering. In this work, we develop a simulation-based template, so-called\nemulator, for the redshift-space power spectrum of dark matter halos. Using the\nredshift-space halo power spectra measured from the Dark Quest $N$-body\nsimulation suite that covers 101 flat-geometry $w$CDM cosmologies around the\nPlanck $\\Lambda$CDM model, we feed these data into a feed-forward neural\nnetwork to build the fast and accurate emulation of the power spectrum from the\nlinear to nonlinear scales up to $k \\simeq 0.6 \\,h \\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our\nemulator achieves about 1% and 5% fractional accuracies in predicting the\nmonopole and quadrupole moments of the power spectrum, respectively, for halos\nof $\\sim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ that correspond to host halos of the SDSS LOWZ-\nand CMASS-like galaxies, where the achieved accuracies are sufficient compared\nto the statistical errors of SDSS volume. The validation and performance of the\nemulator are given by the comparison of the emulator predictions with the power\nspectra directly measured from the simulations for validation sets that are not\nused in the training. We demonstrate that the emulator outputs can be used to\nmake model predictions for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies by\nemploying user-fed models for the halo-galaxy connection, such as the halo\noccupation distribution. The emulator allows us to easily incorporate the\nFinger-of-God effect due to the virial motions of galaxies and the\nAlcock-Paczy\\'{n}ski distortions.

          "abstract": "The cosmic microwave background (CMB), carrying the inhomogeneous information\nof the very early universe, is of great significance for understanding the\norigin and evolution of our universe. However, observational CMB maps contain\nserious foreground contaminations from several sources, such as galactic\nsynchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Here, we build a deep convolutional\nneural network (CNN) to recover the tiny CMB signal from various huge\nforeground contaminations. Focusing on the CMB temperature fluctuations, we\nfind that the CNN model can successfully recover the CMB temperature maps with\nhigh accuracy, and that the deviation of the recovered power spectrum $C_\\ell$\nis smaller than the cosmic variance at $\\ell>10$. We then apply this method to\nthe current Planck observation, and find that the recovered CMB is quite\nconsistent with that disclosed by the Planck collaboration, which indicates\nthat the CNN method can provide a promising approach to the component\nseparation of CMB observations. Furthermore, we test the CNN method with\nsimulated CMB polarization maps based on the CMB-S4 experiment. The result\nshows that both the EE and BB power spectra can be recovered with high\naccuracy.

The standard approach to\nretrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from\nbright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature,\nin contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants\nexhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to\nseparate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from\nthese contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our\nability to detect the 21-cm signal.

          "abstract": "Current and future imaging surveys require photometric redshifts (photo-zs)\nto be estimated for millions of galaxies. Improving the photo-z quality is a\nmajor challenge but is needed to advance our understanding of cosmology. In\nthis paper we explore how the synergies between narrow-band photometric data\nand large imaging surveys can be exploited to improve broadband photometric\nredshifts. We used a multi-task learning (MTL) network to improve broadband\nphoto-z estimates by simultaneously predicting the broadband photo-z and the\nnarrow-band photometry from the broadband photometry. The narrow-band\nphotometry is only required in the training field, which also enables better\nphoto-z predictions for the galaxies without narrow-band photometry in the wide\nfield. This technique was tested with data from the Physics of the Accelerating\nUniverse Survey (PAUS) in the COSMOS field. We find that the method predicts\nphoto-zs that are 13% more precise down to magnitude i_{AB} < 23; the outlier\nrate is also 40% lower when compared to the baseline network.\n  Furthermore, MTL reduces the photo-z bias for high-redshift galaxies,\nimproving the redshift distributions for tomographic bins with z>1. Applying\nthis technique to deeper samples is crucial for future surveys such as \\Euclid\nor LSST. For simulated data, training on a sample with i_{AB} <23, the method\nreduces the photo-z scatter by 16% for all galaxies with i_{AB}<25.

However, spectroscopic observations of the\n4 brightest galaxies (${\\rm H}_{160}{\\sim}25$ mag) at these redshifts do reveal\nprominent Ly$\\alpha$ line, suggesting locally ionised IGM. In this paper, we\nexplore the Ly$\\alpha$ IGM transmission and environment of bright galaxies\nduring the EoR using the Meraxes semi-analytic model.

Fainter galaxies (25.5 mag${<}{\\rm H}_{160}{<}27.5$ mag) have\ntransmission that depends on UV luminosity, leading to a lower incidence of\nLy$\\alpha$ detection at fainter magnitudes.

Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nattenuates Ly$\\alpha$~photons emitted by galaxies. As reionization progressed\nthe IGM opacity decreased, increasing Ly$\\alpha$~visibility. The galaxy\nLy$\\alpha$~luminosity function (LF) is thus a useful tool to constrain the\ntimeline of reionization. In this work, we model the Ly$\\alpha$~LF as a\nfunction of redshift, $z=5-10$, and average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction,\n$\\overline{x}_\\textsc{hi}$. We combine the Ly$\\alpha$~luminosity probability\ndistribution obtained from inhomogeneous reionization simulations with a model\nfor the UV LF to model the Ly$\\alpha$~LF.

When radiative\ntransfer is ignored, direct Ly$\\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest\namplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our\nsimulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\\alpha$ is comparable\nto the Ly$\\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high\nneutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to\ngalaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is\nsensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is\nincluded, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic\nreionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across\nall scales due to dust absorption.

In comoving\nunits, the simulation volume is $2.5 ~ h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc}$ on a side, with a\nresolution of $20~h^{-1}{\\rm pc}$ at the finest refinement level. We analyse\nthe formation and the evolution of central solitonic cores, which are found to\nleave their imprints on dark matter density profiles, resulting in shallower\ncentral densities, and on rotation curves, producing an additional circular\nvelocity peak at small radii from the center. We find that the suppression of\nstructures due to the quantum nature of the scalar field results in an\nshallower halo mass function in the low-mass end compared to the case of a\n$\\Lambda$CDM simulation, in which dark matter is expected to cluster at all\nmass scales even if evolved with the same initial conditions used for fuzzy\ndark matter. Furthermore, we verify the scaling relations characterising the\nsolution to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson system, for both isolated and merging\nhalos, and we find that they are preserved by merging processes. We\ncharacterise each fuzzy dark matter halo in terms of the dimensionless quantity\n$\\Xi \\propto \\left | E_{\\rm halo} \\right |/M_{\\rm halo}^3$ and we show that the\ncore mass is tightly linked to the halo mass by the core-halo mass relation\n$M_{\\rm core}/M_{\\rm halo} \\propto \\Xi^{1/3}$. We also show that the core\nsurface density of the simulated fuzzy dark matter halos does not follow the\nscaling with the core radius as observed for dwarf galaxies, representing a big\nchallenge for the fuzzy dark matter model as the sole explanation of core\nformation.",

          "abstract": "The presence of nine candidate galaxies at $z=17$ and $z=25$ discovered by\nthe James Webb Space Telescope in relatively small sky areas, if confirmed, is\nvirtually impossible to reconcile with the predictions of the current galaxy\nformation model. We show here that the implied UV luminosity density can be\nproduced by a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $M_{\\rm PBH}\n= 10^{4-5} \\, M_{\\odot}$ residing in low-mass halos ($M_h \\approx 10^{7} \\,\nM_{\\odot}$), and accreting at a moderate fraction of the Eddington luminosity,\n$\\lambda_E \\simeq 0.36$. These sources precede the first significant episodes\nof cosmic star formation. At later times, as star formation is ignited, PBH\nemission becomes comparable to, or subdominant with respect to, the galactic\nemission. This PBH+galaxy scenario reconciles the evolution of the UV\nluminosity function (LF) from $z=25$ to $z=11$. If ultra-early sources are\npowered purely by accretion, this strongly disfavours seed production\nmechanisms requiring the presence of stars (massive stars, Pop III stars, or\nclusters), or their UV radiation (direct collapse BHs), leaving PBHs as the\nonly alternative solution available so far. Alternative explanations, such as\nisolated, large clusters ($\\approx 10^7 \\,M_{\\odot}$) of massive ($m_\\star\n=10^3 M_{\\odot}$) Pop III stars are marginally viable, but require extreme and\nunlikely conditions that can be probed via UV and far-infrared (FIR) emission\nlines or gravitational waves.",

Using analytic calculations, we\nexplore the combination of {\\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington\naccretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\\it\ncosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an\nalternative path for \"seeding\" early structures and their baryonic contents.\nAssuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\\rm seed}=25$\nand continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be\nexplained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of\n$f_{\\rm Edd}<= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited\naccretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we\nassume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous\nprimordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75}\nM_\\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $<= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with\nobservational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation\nequality ($z \\sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can\nreproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest\nredshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \\sim 10.3$) with the same parameters\ngoverning star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a\nwide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar\nmass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova\nfeedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its\nhost, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early\nsystems.",

We propose a novel mechanism for the\nformation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume\na non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models;\nthese scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially\nformed in the high-$\\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out\nof which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH\naccretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction.\nPBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense\ncore, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading\nto the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\\sim\n20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\\sim 10^7\\ M_\\odot$ corresponding to $\\sim 5-7\\sigma$\nfluctuations), and provides massive ($\\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\\odot}$) seeds by\n$z\\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that\nprovides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\\rm seed}(z)=3.1\\times 10^{5}\\ {\nM_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\\times 10^{9}\\\n{M_{\\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding\nmechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs,\nnamely $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 3 \\times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\\sim 6-7$ quasars can\nbe explained with $6\\times 10^4 M_{\\rm \\odot}$ seeds planted at $z\\sim 32$, and\ngrowing at sub-Eddington rates, $\\langle\\lambda_{\\rm E}\\rangle\\sim 0.55$. The\nsame scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1\n($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\\sim\n20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\\rm \\odot}$) seeds.
