This problem is exacerbated by the fact that\nperturbation series derived from loop diagram (Feynman diagram) calculations\nrepresent asymptotic (divergent) series which limits the predictive power of\nperturbative quantum field theory. Here, we discuss an ansatz which could\novercome these limits, based on the observations that (i) for many\nphenomenologically relevant field theories, one can derive dispersion relations\nwhich relate the large-order growth (the asymptotic limit of \"infinite loop\norder\") with the imaginary part of arbitrary correlation functions, for\nnegative coupling (\"unstable vacuum\"), and (ii) one can analyze the imaginary\npart for negative coupling in terms of classical field configurations\n(instantons). Unfortunately, the perturbation theory around instantons, which\ncould lead to much more accurate predictions for the large-order behavior of\nFeynman diagrams, poses a number of technical as well as computational\ndifficulties. Here, we study, to further the above mentioned ansatz,\ncorrelation functions in a one-dimensional (1D) field theory with a quartic\nself-interaction and an O(N) internal symmetry group, otherwise known as the 1D\nN-vector model. Our focus is on corrections to the large-order growth of\nperturbative coefficients, i.e., the limit of a large number of loops in the\nFeynman diagram expansion.

Next, we study the Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest in a\nnon-uniformly accelerated frame, with a time dependent acceleration interacting\nwith the field in the Poincar\\'e invariant Fock vacuum state. We evaluate the\npositive frequency Wightman function for the non-uniformly accelerated frame in\na finite time interval and find that it is similar to the two-point correlation\nfunction of a system in equilibrium with a thermal bath. Calculating the\ntransition rate, the non-uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector can be\nexcited even if the scalar field is prepared in the vacuum state.",

Our approach\nis based on triangulating a set of points which can be assigned to a given MB\nintegral, and yields the final analytic results in terms of linear combinations\nof multiple series, each triangulation allowing the derivation of one of these\ncombinations. When this technique is applied to the computation of Feynman\nintegrals, the involved series are of the (multivariable) hypergeometric type.\nWe implement our method in the Mathematica package MBConicHulls.wl, an already\nexisting software dedicated to the analytic evaluation of multiple MB\nintegrals, based on a recently developed computational approach using\nintersections of conic hulls. The triangulation method is remarkably faster\nthan the conic hulls approach and can thus be used for the calculation of\nhigher-fold MB integrals as we show here by computing triangulations for highly\ncomplicated objects such as the off-shell massless scalar one-loop 15-point\nFeynman integral whose MB representation has 104 folds. As other applications\nwe show how this technique can provide new results for the off-shell massless\nconformal hexagon and double box Feynman integrals, as well as for the hard\ndiagram of the two loop hexagon Wilson loop.",

          "abstract": "Feynman integrals play a central role in the modern scattering amplitudes\nresearch program. Advancing our methods for evaluating Feynman integrals will,\ntherefore, strengthen our ability to compare theoretical predictions with data\nfrom particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Motivated by\nthis, the present manuscript purports to study mathematical concepts related to\nFeynman integrals. In particular, we present both numerical and analytical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of Feynman integrals.\n  The content is divided into three parts. Part I focuses on the method of DEQs\nfor evaluating Feynman integrals. An otherwise daunting integral expression is\nthereby traded for the comparatively simpler task of solving a system of DEQs.\nWe use this technique to evaluate a family of two-loop Feynman integrals of\nrelevance for dark matter detection. Part II situates the study of DEQs for\nFeynman integrals within the framework of D-modules, a natural language for\nstudying PDEs algebraically. Special emphasis is put on a particular D-module\ncalled the GKZ system, a set of higher-order PDEs that annihilate a generalized\nversion of a Feynman integral. In the course of matching the generalized\nintegral to a Feynman integral proper, we discover an algorithm for evaluating\nthe latter in terms of logarithmic series. Part III develops a numerical\nintegration algorithm. It combines Monte Carlo sampling with tropical geometry,\na particular offspring of algebraic geometry that studies \"piecewise-linear\"\npolynomials. Feynman's i*epsilon-prescription is incorporated into the\nalgorithm via contour deformation. We present an open-source program named\nFeyntrop that implements this algorithm, and use it to numerically evaluate\nFeynman integrals between 1-5 loops and 0-5 legs in physical regions of phase\nspace.",
