An increase in\nelectron bunch quality and energy is achieved experimentally with the extension\nof the density downramp at the plasma exit. Optimisation of the focal position\nof the laser pulse in the tailored plasma density profile is shown to\nefficiently reduce electron bunch angular deviation, leading to a better\nalignment of the electron bunch with the laser axis. Single peak electron\nspectra are produced in a previously unexplored regime by combining an early\nfocal position and adaptive optic control of the laser wavefront through\noptimising the symmetry of the pre-focal laser energy distribution.\nExperimental results have been validated through particle-in-cell simulations\nusing realistic laser energy, phase distribution, and temporal envelope,\nallowing for accurate predictions of difficult to model parameters, such as\ntotal charge and spatial properties of the electron bunches, opening the way\nfor more accurate modelling for the design of plasma-based accelerators.",

This regime is typical for kJ PW-class laser\nfacilities designed for high energy density research. Currently, in experiments\nat the PHELX laser it was demonstrated that interaction of 10$^{19}$ W/cm$^{2}$\nsub-ps laser pulse with sub-mm long NCD plasma results in generation of\nhigh-current well-directed super-ponderomotive electrons with effective\ntemperature that is 10$\\times$ higher than the ponderomotive potential [O.\nRosmej et al., PPCF 62, 115024 (2020)]. Three-dimensional Particle-In-Cell\nsimulations provided a good agreement with the measured electron energy\ndistribution and were used in the current work to study synchrotron radiation\nof the DLA accelerated electrons. The resulting x-ray spectrum with a critical\nenergy of 5 keV reveals an ultra-high photon number of 7$\\times$10$^{11}$ in\nthe 1-30 keV photon energy range at the focused laser energy of 20 J. Numerical\nsimulations of a betatron x-ray phasecontrast imaging based on the DLA process\nfor the parameters of a PHELIX laser is presented. The results are of interest\nfor applications in high energy density (HED) experiments, which require a\npicosecond x-ray pulse and a high photon flux.",

The breakthrough\ntoward high current relativistic electron beams became possible due to\napplication of low density polymer foams of sub-mm thickness. In foams, the\nNCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of super-sonic ionization.

Measurements resulted into\n11{\\div}13 MeV of the effective electron temperature and up to 100 MeV maximum\nof the electron energy measured in the laser pulse propagation direction. The\ngrowth of the electron energy was accompanied by a strong increase of the\nnumber of super-ponderomotive electrons and a well-defined directionality of\nthe electron beam that propagates in a divergence cone with a half angle of\n12{\\deg}. For the energy range above 7.5 MeV that is relevant for gamma-driven\nnuclear reactions, we estimate a charge carried by these well-directed electron\nbeams as high as 50 nC and a corresponding efficiency of the laser energy\nconversion into electrons of 6%.

This distribution function is initially\nstable with respect to kinetic instabilities. Expansion drives the solar wind\ninto successive regimes where whistler heat flux instabilities are triggered.\nThese instabilities produce sunward whistler waves initially characterized by\npredominantly oblique propagation with respect to the interplanetary magnetic\nfield.

          "abstract": "The 3D quasi-static particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm is a very efficient\nmethod for modeling short-pulse laser or relativistic charged particle\nbeam-plasma interactions. In this algorithm, the plasma response to a\nnon-evolving laser or particle beam is calculated using Maxwell's equations\nbased on the quasi-static approximate equations that exclude radiation. The\nplasma fields are then used to advance the laser or beam forward using a large\ntime step. The algorithm is many orders of magnitude faster than a 3D fully\nexplicit relativistic electromagnetic PIC algorithm. It has been shown to be\ncapable to accurately model the evolution of lasers and particle beams in a\nvariety of scenarios. At the same time, an algorithm in which the fields,\ncurrents and Maxwell equations are decomposed into azimuthal harmonics has been\nshown to reduce the complexity of a 3D explicit PIC algorithm to that of a 2D\nalgorithm when the expansion is truncated while maintaining accuracy for\nproblems with near azimuthal symmetry. This hybrid algorithm uses a PIC\ndescription in r-z and a gridless description in $\\phi$. We describe a novel\nmethod that combines the quasi-static and hybrid PIC methods. This algorithm\nexpands the fields, charge and current density into azimuthal harmonics. A set\nof the quasi-static field equations are derived for each harmonic. The complex\namplitudes of the fields are then solved using the finite difference method.\nThe beam and plasma particles are advanced in Cartesian coordinates using the\ntotal fields. Details on how this algorithm was implemented using a similar\nworkflow to an existing quasi-static code, QuickPIC, are presented. The new\ncode is called QPAD for QuickPIC with Azimuthal Decomposition. Benchmarks and\ncomparisons between a fully 3D explicit PIC code, a full 3D quasi-static code,\nand the new quasi-static PIC code with azimuthal decomposition are also\npresented.",

The physics\nfidelity is considerably increased compared to previous studies, by e.g., using\nrealistic magnetic geometry, resistive wall configuration, thermal quench onset\ncriteria, as well as including additional effects, such as ion transport and\nenhanced runaway electron transport during the thermal quench. The work aims to\nprovide a fairly comprehensive coverage of experimentally feasible scenarios,\nconsidering plasmas representative of both non-activated and high-performance\nDT operation, different thermal quench onset criteria and transport levels, a\nwide range of hydrogen and neon quantities injected in one or two stages, and\npellets with various characteristic shard sizes. Using a staggered injection\nscheme, with a pure hydrogen injection preceding a mixed hydrogen-neon\ninjection, we find injection parameters leading to acceptable runaway electron\ncurrents in all investigated discharges without activated runaway sources.\nDividing the injection into two stages is found to significantly enhance the\nassimilation and minimize runaway electron generation due to the hot-tail\nmechanism. However, while a staggered injection outperforms a single stage\ninjection also in cases with radioactive runaway electron sources, no cases\nwith acceptable runaway electron currents are found for a DT-plasma with a 15\nMA plasma current.",

In this paper, we\nderive a Grad-Shafranov-like equation solving for the axisymmetric drift\nsurfaces of the runaway electrons for the simple case that all runaway electron\nshare the same parallel momentum. This new equilibrium equation is then\nnumerically solved with simple rectangular wall with ITER-like and MAST-like\ngeometry parameters. The deviation between the drift surfaces and the flux\nsurfaces is readily obtained, and runaway electrons is found to be well\nconfined even in regions with open field lines. The change of the runaway\nelectron parallel momentum is found to result in a horizontal current center\ndisplacement without any changes in the total current or the external field.\nThe runaway current density profile is found to affect the susceptibility of\nsuch displacement, with flatter profiles result in more displacement by the\nsame momentum change. With up-down asymmetry in the external poloidal field,\nsuch displacement is accompanied by a vertical displacement of runaway electron\ncurrent. It is found that this effect is more pronounced in smaller, compact\ndevice and weaker poloidal field cases. The above results demonstrate the\ndynamics of current center displacement caused by the momentum space change in\nthe runaway electrons, and pave way for future, more sophisticated runaway\ncurrent equilibrium theory with more realistic consideration on the runaway\nelectron momentum distribution. This new equilibrium theory also provides\nfoundation for future stability analysis of the runaway electron current.",

          "abstract": "Equilibrium equations for magnetically confined, axisymmetric plasmas are\nderived by means of the energy-Casimir variational principle in the context of\nHall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This approach stems from the noncanonical\nHamiltonian structure of Hall MHD, the simplest, quasineutral two-fluid model\nthat incorporates contributions due to ion Hall drifts. The axisymmetric\nCasimir invariants are used, along with the Hamiltonian functional to apply the\nenergy-Casimir variational principle for axisymmetric two-fluid plasmas with\nincompressible ion flows. This results in a system of equations of the\nGrad-Shafranov-Bernoulli (GSB) type with four free functions. Two families of\nanalytic solutions to the GSB system are then calculated, based on specific\nchoices for the free functions. These solutions are subsequently applied to\nTokamak-relevant configurations using proper boundary shaping methods. The Hall\nMHD model predicts a departure of the ion velocity surfaces from the magnetic\nsurfaces which are frozen in the electron fluid. This separation of the\ncharacteristic surfaces is corroborated by the analytic solutions calculated in\nthis study. The equilibria constructed by these solutions exhibit favorable\ncharacteristics for plasma confinement, for example they possess closed and\nnested magnetic and flow surfaces with pressure profiles peaked at the plasma\ncore.

We use the variational principle\nto find conservation laws for circulation, vorticity when pressure vanishes,\nand energy in axisymmetric domains. Combining the Lie-Poisson structure with a\nconstruction due to Scovel-Weinstein, we develop a theory of smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrostatics (SPMHS). SPMHS identifies a large class of exact\nparticle-swarm solutions of regularized spatial dynamics equations. The\nregularization occurs at finer scales than the smallest scales within the\nphysical purview of ideal MHD. Crucially, the SPMHS equations of motion\ncomprise a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, which side steps perennial\nroadblocks to a satisfactory theory of three-dimensional equilibria. In\nlarge-aspect-ratio domains, we show the spatial dynamics equations comprise a\nfast-slow system, where fast dynamics corresponds to the elliptic part of the\nequilibrium equations and slow dynamics corresponds to the hyperbolic part.\nBecause the fast dynamics is formally normally hyperbolic, Fenichel theory\nsuggests the presence of an exact slow manifold for the spatial dynamics\nequations that contains all physical solutions.
