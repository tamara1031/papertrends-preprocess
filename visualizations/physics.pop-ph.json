With categorical quantum mechanics\n(CQM), quantum theory is re-formalized into a more intuitive diagrammatic\napproach, which we will refer to as the first level of transformation, to\nimprove the accessibility and readability of quantum theory to a broader\naudience since the mathematical details are embedded into diagrammatic rules.\nTaking inspiration from this diagrammatic approach, we propose the second level\nof transformation by gamifying the diagrammatic rules of quantum teleportation\ninto a quantum card game called Quantum Port. In this work, we discuss the\ngamification process of quantum teleportation and provide a printable version\nof Quantum Port for public engagement.",

With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several\ncommunication technologies and the quantum internet in the future, it is\nimperative to create learning tools and approaches that can accurately and\neffectively communicate the concept. Recent research has indicated the\nimportance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics.\nTherefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to\nfind engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting\ntopics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm to\nteach the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas gift-bringer\nSanta Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual context to\nexplore the key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without being overly\nabstract. In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom\nsetting which is based on common naive conceptions from quantum physics. This\nworksheet will be evaluated as a classroom resource to teach quantum\nteleportation in a subsequent study.",

          "abstract": "Understanding quantum mechanics is inherently challenging due to its\ncounterintuitive principles. Quantum Intuition XR is an interactive, extended\nreality (XR) experience designed to make quantum concepts tangible. Our system\nvisualizes core principles of quantum computing, including qubits,\nsuperposition, entanglement, and measurement, through immersive interaction.\nUsing a Mixed Reality headset, participants engage with floating qubits,\nmanipulate their states via controllers, and observe entanglement dynamics\nthrough real-time audiovisual feedback. A key feature of our implementation is\nthe mathematically accurate and dynamic representation of qubits, both\nindividually and while interacting with each other. The visualization of the\nqubit states evolve -- rotate, shrink, grow, entangle -- depending on their\nactual quantum states, which depend on variables such as proximity to other\nqubits and user interaction. Preliminary expert interviews and demonstrations\nwith quantum specialists indicate that the system accurately represents quantum\nphenomena, suggesting strong potential to educate and enhance quantum intuition\nfor non-expert audiences. This approach bridges abstract quantum mechanics with\nembodied learning, offering an intuitive and accessible way for users to\nexplore quantum phenomena. Future work will focus on expanding multi-user\ninteractions and refining the fidelity of quantum state visualizations.",

          "abstract": "The Astro2020 report outlines numerous recommendations that could\nsignificantly advance technosignature science. Technosignatures refer to any\nobservable manifestations of extraterrestrial technology, and the search for\ntechnosignatures is part of the continuum of the astrobiological search for\nbiosignatures. The search for technosignatures is directly relevant to the\n\"World and Suns in Context\" theme and \"Pathways to Habitable Worlds\" program in\nthe Astro2020 report. The relevance of technosignatures was explicitly\nmentioned in \"E1 Report of the Panel on Exoplanets, Astrobiology, and the Solar\nSystem,\" which stated that \"life's global impacts on a planet's atmosphere,\nsurface, and temporal behavior may therefore manifest as potentially detectable\nexoplanet biosignatures, or technosignatures\" and that potential\ntechnosignatures, much like biosignatures, must be carefully analyzed to\nmitigate false positives. The connection of technosignatures to this high-level\ntheme and program can be emphasized, as the report makes clear the purpose is\nto address the question \"Are we alone?\" This question is also presented in the\nExplore Science 2020-2024 plan as a driver of NASA's mission.\n  This white paper summarizes the potential technosignature opportunities\nwithin the recommendations of the Astro2020 report, should they be implemented\nby funding agencies. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the\nrelevance of technosignature science to a wide range of missions and urge the\nscientific community to include the search for technosignatures as part of the\nstated science justifications for the large and medium programs that include\nthe Infrared/Optical/Ultraviolet space telescope, Extremely Large Telescopes,\nprobe-class far-infrared and X-ray missions, and various facilities in radio\nastronomy.",

Most previous searches for\ntechnosignatures have focused on searches for radio signals, but many current\nand future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence of some\nnon-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader\nparticipation by the astronomical community, as contributions to\ntechnosignature science can also take the form of negative results that provide\nstatistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence of a signal.\nThis paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes\nworkshop, which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to\nprioritize and guide future theoretical and observational studies\ntechnosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use of\ncurrent and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at\nultraviolet, optical, or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on\nthe detectability of atmospheric technosignatures, artificial surface\nmodifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and\ninterstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative\ndetection limits but is intended to provide additional science justification\nfor the use of current and planned observing facilities as well as to inspire\nastronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance of their\nongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies\npossible technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to\nsearch for technosignatures, which suggests the need to consider\ntechnosignature science cases in the design of future mission concepts.",

          "abstract": "The field of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches for\n``technosignatures'' that could provide the first detection of life beyond\nEarth through the technology that an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may\nhave created. Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected,\nshould set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have\nbeen able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their\ntarget sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio\ntransmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have\ndeveloped. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the\naxis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods\ncommensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of\ndetectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio\ntransmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures,\nand objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth\ninstruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of\nthe growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's\nspace-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with\nintermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar)\nbeating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection\ndistance. This work highlights the growing range of ways that exoplanet\ntechnosignatures may be expressed, the growing complexity and visibility of the\nhuman impact upon our planet, and the continued importance of the radio\nfrequencies in SETI.",

          "abstract": "The momentum of human spaceflight initiatives continues to build toward Mars,\nand technological advances may eventually enable the potential for permanent\nspace settlement. Aspirations for sustaining human life in space must be\npredicated on human factors, rather than technological constraints alone, and\nadvances in models of governance and ethics are necessary as human civilization\nbecomes a spacefaring species. This paper presents an idealistic but feasible\nmodel for economic freedom on Mars, which is situated within a framework in\nwhich Mars has been designated as a sovereign juridical peer to Earth. Under\nsuch conditions, Mars could maintain monetary stability through full reserve\nbanking and a restriction on exchange with any fractional reserve Earth\ncurrencies, with a volume of circulating currency that changes based on the\ntotal population within fixed capacity infrastructure. Mars could maintain\nlong-term political stability by diffusing the ownership of capital on Mars,\nwhich would allow all citizens of Mars to draw sufficient wealth from a\ncombination of capital ownership and labor to live a good life. This model\ncould also support limited tourism on Mars, in which real goods are exchanged\nfor services but currency transactions between planets are prohibited. This\nmodel demonstrates the potential for a viable and sustainable economy on Mars\nthat could conceivably be implemented, including on a sovereign Mars but also\nin other scenarios of space settlement. More broadly, this model illustrates\nthat ideas such as diffuse capital ownership and limited government can enable\nfreedom in space, and numerous models beyond a centralized world space agency\nshould be explored to ensure the optimal governance of the emerging space\neconomy.",

          "year": "2021-11",
          "abstract": "If humanity is ever to consider substantial, long-term colonization of Mars,\nthe resources needed are going to be extensive. For a long-term human presence\non Mars to be established, serious thought would need to be given to\nterraforming the planet. One major requirement for such terraforming is having\nthe protection of a planetary magnetic field which Mars currently does not\nhave. In this article we explore comprehensively for the first time, the\npractical and engineering challenges that affect the feasibility of creating an\nartificial magnetic field capable of encompassing Mars. This includes the\nconcerns that define the design, where to locate the magnetic field generator\nand possible construction strategies. The rationale here is not to justify the\nneed for a planetary magnetosphere but to put figures on the practicalities so\nas to be able to weigh the pros and cons of the different engineering\napproaches.\n  The optimum solution proposed is completely novel, although inspired by\nnatural situations and fusion plasma techniques. The solution with the lowest\npower, assembly and mass is to create an artificial charged particle ring\n(similar in form to a \"radiation belt\"), around the planet possibly formed by\nejecting matter from one of the moons of Mars (in fashion similar to that that\nforms the Io-Jupiter plasma torus), but using electromagnetic and plasma waves\nto drive a net current in the ring(s) that results in an overall magnetic\nfield.\n  With a new era of space exploration underway, this is the time to start\nthinking about these new and bold future concepts and to begin filling\nstrategic knowledge gaps. Furthermore, the principles explored here are also\napplicable to smaller scale objects like manned spacecraft, space stations or\nmoon bases, which would benefit from the creation of protective\nmini-magnetospheres.",

          "year": "2021-04",
          "abstract": "Generating renewable energy on Mars is technologically challenging. Firstly,\nbecause compared to Earth, key energy resources such as solar and wind are weak\nas a result of very low atmospheric pressure and low solar irradiation.\nSecondly, because of the harsh environmental conditions, the required high\ndegree of automation and the exceptional effort and costs to transport material\nto the planet. Like on Earth, it is crucial to combine complementary resources\nfor an effective renewable energy solution. In this work, we present the result\nof a design synthesis exercise, a 10 kW microgrid solution, based on a pumping\nkite power system and photovoltaic solar modules to power the construction as\nwell as the subsequent use of a Mars habitat. To buffer unavoidable energy\nfluctuations and balance seasonal and diurnal resource variations, the two\nenergy systems are combined with a compressed gas storage system and\nlithium-sulfur batteries. The airborne wind energy solution was selected\nbecause of its low weight-to-wing-surface-area ratio, compact packing volume\nand high capacity factor which enables it to endure strong dust storms in an\nairborne parking mode. The surface area of the membrane wing is 50 m2 and the\nmass of the entire system, including the kite control unit and ground station,\nis 290 kg. The performance of the microgrid is assessed by computational\nsimulation using available resource data for a chosen deployment location on\nMars. The projected costs of the system are 8.95 million Euro, excluding\ntransportation to Mars.",

          "abstract": "The origin of life and the detection of alien life have historically been\ntreated as separate scientific research problems. However, they are not\nstrictly independent. Here, we discuss the need for a better integration of the\nsciences of life detection and origins of life. Framing these dual problems\nwithin the formalism of Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show via simple\nexamples how high confidence in life detection claims require either (1) a\nstrong prior hypothesis about the existence of life in a particular alien\nenvironment, or conversely, (2) signatures of life that are not susceptible to\nfalse positives. As a case study, we discuss the role of priors and hypothesis\ntesting in recent results reporting potential detection of life in the Venusian\natmosphere and in the icy plumes of Enceladus. While many current leading\nbiosignature candidates are subject to false positives because they are not\ndefinitive of life, our analyses demonstrate why it is necessary to shift focus\nto candidate signatures that are definitive. This indicates a necessity to\ndevelop methods that lack false positives, by using observables for life that\nrely on prior hypotheses with strong theoretical and empirical support in\nidentifying defining features of life. Abstract theories developed in pursuit\nof understanding universal features of life are more likely to be definitive\nand to apply to life-as-we-don't-know-it. In the absence of alien examples\nthese are best validated in origin of life experiments, substantiating the need\nfor better integration between origins of life and biosignature science\nresearch communities.",

          "year": "2021-03",
          "abstract": "In the modern search for life elsewhere in the Universe, we are broadly\nlooking for the following: the planets similar to Earth - physical indicators\nof habitability, and the manifestation of life - the biological signatures. A\nbiosignature is a measured parameter that has a high probability of being\ncaused by the living organisms, either atmospheric gas species or some surface\nfeatures. Therefore, the focus of a search is on a product or phenomena\nproduced by the living systems, mostly by microorganisms as these are the most\nabundant on our planet like, say, methane. However, we may need to distinguish\nthe terms `biosignature' and `bioindicator'. A biosignature is what living\norganisms produce - a bioproduct, while a bioindicator may be anything\nnecessary for life as we know it, such as water or a rocky planet. Oxygen in\nthis case is a double biomarker; first, it is a byproduct of oxygenic\nphotosynthesis and, second, it is a signature of a complex life, because\ncomplex highly organized life requires high levels of oxygen. It is possible\nthat there are other such bioindicators. For example, in the atmospheric\ncompositions of terrestrial planets in our Solar System (including Titan),\nargon is one of the major constituents, moreover it was recently acknowledged\nto be a `biologically' active gas, exhibiting organprotective and\nneuroprotective properties, especially under hypoxic conditions. Here we\npropose that argon in the atmosphere of a rocky planet is a bioindicator of a\nhighly organized life, provided that the planet is already deemed potentially\nhabitable: with water, atmosphere, and of a certain age allowing for the\ncomplex life to evolve. We also delineate its possible detection methods.",

          "abstract": "Although many solar systems have been discovered, only one example of life is\nknown. Thus, terrestrial life represents merely one data point. Consequently,\nextrapolating from terrestrial life to life elsewhere in the galaxy and beyond\nis often seen as a limitation in the search for different forms of life.\nEssentially, attempting to extrapolate from terrestrial life to life elsewhere\nimplies that terrestrial life is representative of all life, reflecting a\ngeocentric viewpoint. However, in accordance with the Copernican principle, the\nopposite holds true. Asserting that terrestrial life must differ from other\nforms of life in the universe is, in fact, the geocentric viewpoint. For if\nlife elsewhere is not like terrestrial life, then it is ipso facto different\nlife; more precisely, if terrestrial life does not represent general life, then\nthat life must represent special life, which the principle states it is not.\nThis study employs the Copernican principle as a probability assessment,\naddressing critiques rooted in the implicit assumption of the existence of\ndifferent extraterrestrial forms of life. If various fundamental forms of life\nindeed exist, then differences in the probabilities of their emergence can be\nexpected, forming a probability scale. This holds significance because it not\nonly allows for insights into the characteristics of the majority of life\nelsewhere but also facilitates the establishment of boundaries for categories\nof life as we do not know it. Thus, the Copernican-Darwinian principle provides\na valuable tool for astrobiology and the search for life in the galaxy and\nbeyond.",
