Here, we report on\nthe experimental observation of a paradigmatic many-body problem, namely the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed in a bosonic\nenvironment. We use an interferometric technique to prepare coherent\nsuperposition states of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate with a small\nimpurity-state component, and monitor the evolution of such quantum\nsuperpositions into polaronic quasiparticles. These results offer a systematic\npicture of polaron formation from weak to strong impurity interactions. They\nreveal three distinct regimes of evolution with dynamical transitions that\nprovide a link between few-body processes and many-body dynamics. Our\nmeasurements reveal universal dynamical behavior in interacting many-body\nsystems and demonstrate new pathways to study non-equilibrium quantum\nphenomena.",

Long-range interactions play an important role in nature; however,\nquantum simulations of lattice systems have largely not been able to realize\nsuch interactions. A wide range of efforts are underway to explore long-range\ninteracting lattice systems using polar molecules, Rydberg atoms, optical\ncavities, and magnetic atoms. Here, we realize novel quantum phases in a\nstrongly correlated lattice system with long-range dipolar interactions using\nultracold magnetic erbium atoms. As we tune the dipolar interaction to be the\ndominant energy scale in our system, we observe quantum phase transitions from\na superfluid into dipolar quantum solids, which we directly detect using\nquantum gas microscopy with accordion lattices. Controlling the interaction\nanisotropy by orienting the dipoles enables us to realize a variety of stripe\nordered states. Furthermore, by transitioning non-adiabatically through the\nstrongly correlated regime, we observe the emergence of a range of metastable\nstripe-ordered states. This work demonstrates that novel strongly correlated\nquantum phases can be realized using long-range dipolar interaction in optical\nlattices, opening the door to quantum simulations of a wide range of lattice\nmodels with long-range and anisotropic interactions.",

The interplay of\ndifferent energy scales yields a rich phase diagram with superfluid and\ninsulating phases exhibiting density modulation or spin ordering. In\nparticular, the combined effect of contact and global-range interactions gives\nrise to an antiferromagnetically ordered phase for arbitrarily small\nspin-dependent light-matter coupling, while long-range and inter-spin contact\ninteractions introduce regions of instability and phase separation in the phase\ndiagram. We further study the low energy excitations above the\nantiferrogmagnetic phase. Besides particle-hole branches, it hosts\nspin-exchange excitations with a tunable energy gap.

We use these `twisted' electrons to provide an\nalternative interpretation on existing experimental work of vortex\ninterferences caused by strong field ionization mediated by two counterrotating\ncircularly polarized pulses separated by a delay. Using the strong field\napproximation, we derive an interference condition for the vortices.

For each of these approaches we examine the OAM of the\nphotoelectrons, finding a small number of vortex states localized in separate\nenergy regions. We demonstrate that the vortices arise from the interference of\npairs of twisted electron states. The OAM of each twisted electron state can be\ndirectly related to the number of arms of the spiral in that region. We gain\nfurther understanding by recreating the vortices with pairs of twisted\nelectrons and use this to determine a semiclassical relation for the OAM.

It is further found that the electron\nfrom the counter-rotating term plays an important role in the interference. In\nthe case of the two-color pulse, both the time-energy distributions and the\nionization time distributions change with varying IR field. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the IR field not only modifies the final electron kinetic\nenergy but also changes the electron's emission time, which results from the\nchange of the electric field induced by the IR pulse.

The comparison of the\npresent numerical calculations with the predictions from empirical nuclear\ncharge models, the non-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations, and the\nresults based on experimental charge densities indicate that both the nuclear\ncharge radius and the detailed shape of charge density distribution play\nimportant roles in determining the FNS corrections.

Finally, using\nthree-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks, we realize computationally complex\nsampling circuits with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube\nconnectivity with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates. We find\nthat this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with\nerror detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy\nbenchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling. These results herald\nthe advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward\nlarge-scale logical processors.",

          "abstract": "The ability to perform entangling quantum operations with low error rates in\na scalable fashion is a central element of useful quantum information\nprocessing. Neutral atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising quantum\ncomputing platform, featuring coherent control over hundreds of qubits and\nany-to-any gate connectivity in a flexible, dynamically reconfigurable\narchitecture. The major outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in\nentangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions. Here we report the\nrealization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5% fidelity on up to 60 atoms\nin parallel, surpassing the surface code threshold for error correction. Our\nmethod employs fast single-pulse gates based on optimal control, atomic dark\nstates to reduce scattering, and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom\ncooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate\napplications, characterize the physical error sources, and outline future\nimprovements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates\ninvolving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing\nlow-error three-qubit gates. By enabling high-fidelity operation in a scalable,\nhighly connected system, these advances lay the groundwork for large-scale\nimplementation of quantum algorithms, error-corrected circuits, and digital\nsimulations.",

In addition, even the five percent of ordinary matter in our Universe\nhas yet to be understood, since the Standard Model of particle physics lacks\nany consistent explanation for the predominance of matter over antimatter.\nInspired by these central problems of modern physics, we present here a direct\nsearch for interactions of antimatter with dark matter, and place direct\nconstraints on the interaction of ultra-light axion-like particles $-$ one of\nthe dark-matter candidates $-$ and antiprotons. If antiprotons exhibit a\nstronger coupling to these dark-matter particles than protons, such a CPT-odd\ncoupling could provide a link between dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in\nthe Universe.

A key\nlimitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in\ntypically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband\ntransitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light\nprofiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive;\nmotivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude\nstability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide\naddressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG)\nmodes.

Carrier-free EIT offers\nsignificant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency\nbandwidth, and final phonon number.

In recent years,\nintegrated-photonics-based systems have been demonstrated as an avenue to\naddress the challenge of scaling trapped-ion systems while maintaining high\nfidelities. While these previous demonstrations have implemented both Doppler\nand resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions, these cooling techniques are\nfundamentally limited in efficiency. In contrast, polarization-gradient cooling\ncan enable faster and more power-efficient cooling and, therefore, improved\ncomputational efficiencies in trapped-ion systems. While free-space\nimplementations of polarization-gradient cooling have demonstrated advantages\nover other cooling mechanisms, polarization-gradient cooling has never\npreviously been implemented using integrated photonics. In this paper, we\ndesign and experimentally demonstrate key polarization-diverse\nintegrated-photonics devices and utilize them to implement a variety of\nintegrated-photonics-based polarization-gradient-cooling systems, culminating\nin the first experimental demonstration of polarization-gradient cooling of a\ntrapped ion by an integrated-photonics-based system.
