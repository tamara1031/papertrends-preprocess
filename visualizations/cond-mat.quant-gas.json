          "abstract": "We investigate the roles of non-Hermitian topology in spectral properties and\nentanglement structures of open systems. In terms of spectral theory, we give a\nunified understanding of two interpretations of non-Hermitian topology: quantum\nanomaly and non-Hermitian skin effects, in which the bulk spectra extremely\ndepend on the boundary conditions. In this context, the fact that the intrinsic\nhigher-dimensional skin effects under the full open boundary condition need the\npresence of the topological defects is understood in terms of the anomalous\nfermion production such as the Rubakov-Callan effect in the presence of the\nmagnetic monopole. In terms of the entanglement structure, we investigate\nsteady states of fermionic open systems whose Liouvillian (rapidity) spectra\nhost non-Hermitian topology. We analyze dissipation-driven Majorana steady\nstates in zero-dimensional open systems and relate them to the Majorana edge\nmodes of topological superconductors by using the entanglement entropy. We also\nanalyze a steady state of a one-dimensional open Fermi system with a\nnon-Hermitian topological spectrum and relate it to the chiral edge states of\nthe Chern insulator on the basis of the trace index defined from the\nentanglement spectrum. These correspondences indicate that the entanglement\ngenerates circular nonreciprocal currents under the periodic boundary condition\nand the skin-effect voltage with fermion accumulation under the open boundary\ncondition. Finally, we discuss several related topics such as pseudospectral\nbehaviors of Liouvillian dynamics and skin effects in interacting systems.",

          "abstract": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the boundary-localized\neigenstates under open boundary conditions, has revealed the breakdown of Bloch\nband theory in non-Hermitian lattices. While one-dimensional non-Hermitian\nbands are well-described by the non-Bloch band theory, its extension to higher\ndimensions is challenged by the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where\nthe energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates depend on\nthe system's geometry. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a\nuniversal theoretical framework based on the strip generalized Brillouin zone\n(SGBZ). Our framework provides a systematic description of the GDSE, explains\nits origin through the competition between incompatible SGBZs, and provides for\nthe first time a clear criterion for its emergence. We also unify our SGBZ\nframework with the Amoeba formulation by showing that the Amoeba spectrum is\nthe superset of all possible SGBZ spectra, thereby clarifying its domain of\nvalidity. This work establishes a foundation for studying higher-dimensional\nnon-Hermitian systems, paving the way for the future investigation of novel\nhigher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics, such as hybrid skin-topological\neffects and non-Hermitian Chern bands.",

Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central\ntopic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on\nboundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been\nextended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex.\nBesides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon\ncalled the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the\nspectrum to the boundary condition.

          "year": "2025-07",
          "abstract": "Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an\nopen quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary\nevolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the\nlatter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.\nSeemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state\nhas spectral weight on the so-called quantum many-body scar states, which are\nnon-thermalizing eigenstates embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal\neigenstates. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence\nof quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems, particular to systems which\nexhibit scars-induced entanglement oscillations. We exemplify this with the PXP\nmodel and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of\nscarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to\nhave significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing\ninformation backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between\ntemporally-separated transient states of small subsystems, systematic\nsignatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it\nis seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced\n(diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. The retention of memory and revivals\nbetween transient subsystem states is a finer form of memory effect than\ncaptured by the revivals of full system's fidelity with the initial states.\nThis sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum\nscarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum\nscarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating\nfar-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.",

In quantum many-body systems, the\nlate-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved\noperators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model\nunder investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry\nrestricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum\nmany-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation\nfunctions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional\nform of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the\nquantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport;\ncounterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the\naforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy\nclose to the scars.",

Lots of experiments report the transition from a thermal\nequilibrium phase to time crystal phase. However, there is no experimental\nmethod to probe the bifurcation effect of distinct time crystals in quantum\nmany-body systems. Here, in a driven and dissipative many-body Rydberg atom\nsystem, we observe multiple continuous dissipative time crystals and emergence\nof more complex temporal symmetries beyond the single time crystal phase.\nBifurcation of time crystals in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms is observed;\nthe process manifests as a transition from a time crystal state of long\ntemporal order to one of short temporal order, or vice versa. By manipulating\nthe driving field parameters, we observe the time crystal's bistability and a\nhysteresis loop. These investigations indicate new possibilities for control\nand manipulation of the temporal symmetries of non-equilibrium systems.",

          "abstract": "Quantum many-body control is a central milestone en route to harnessing\nquantum technologies. However, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space\ndimension with the number of qubits makes it challenging to classically\nsimulate quantum many-body systems and consequently, to devise reliable and\nrobust optimal control protocols. Here, we present a novel framework for\nefficiently controlling quantum many-body systems based on reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We tackle the quantum control problem by leveraging matrix\nproduct states (i) for representing the many-body state and, (ii) as part of\nthe trainable machine learning architecture for our RL agent. The framework is\napplied to prepare ground states of the quantum Ising chain, including states\nin the critical region. It allows us to control systems far larger than\nneural-network-only architectures permit, while retaining the advantages of\ndeep learning algorithms, such as generalizability and trainable robustness to\nnoise. In particular, we demonstrate that RL agents are capable of finding\nuniversal controls, of learning how to optimally steer previously unseen\nmany-body states, and of adapting control protocols on-the-fly when the quantum\ndynamics is subject to stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we map the QMPS\nframework to a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that can be performed on\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and test it under the presence of\nexperimentally relevant sources of noise.",
