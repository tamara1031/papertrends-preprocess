Exact solutions are sought under certain basic conditions for the\nrelated field equations. For the following theoretically valid premises, the\nfield equations in this scalar-tensor theory have been solved. It is observed\nunder appropriate conditions that our model shows a decelerating to\naccelerating phase transition property. Results are observed to be coherent\nwith recent observations. Here, our models predict that the universe's rate of\nexpansion will increase with the passage of time. The physical and geometric\naspects of the models are discussed in detail.

In this model, dark matter quanta are sterile massless particles\nthat are emitted from the central regions of the galaxy in the radial\ndirection. As a result, at large distances $r$ from the center of the galaxy,\nthe mass density of dark matter has the form $\\rho \\sim r^{-2}$, in contrast to\nthe homogeneous model $\\rho=Const$. In the cosmological context, the\nhomogeneous model with massless particles corresponds to the radiation epoch of\nthe expansion of the universe, while the proposed inhomogeneous model turns out\nto be equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM. In this paper, scenarios will be considered\nin which the radial emission of dark matter is brought into hydrostatic\nequilibrium with a uniform background. It is shown that solutions exist if the\nuniform background has an equation of state typical for dark energy. Thus, this\nmodel describes a phase transition from dark matter inside the galaxy to dark\nenergy outside of it. The specific mechanism for such a transition could be\nBose-Einstein condensation.

In conjunction with the composite Higgs model, we examine the\nvierbein field as a Cooper-pair-like fermion-antifermion condensation. Quantum\ngravity is realized indirectly via the quantized standard model spinor fields\nwhich underlie the composite space-time metric. We propose that the fundamental\nenergy scales of the universe including the Planck scale are emergent and\nresulted from quantum condensations, thus possibly addressing the cosmological\nconstant problem through an unconventional multi-scale renormalization\nprocedure for multiplications of divergent Feynman integrals. The Clifford\nalgebra approach also permits a weaker form of charge conjugation without\nparticle-antiparticle interchange, leading to a Majorana-type mass that\nconserves lepton number. Additionally, with reshuffling the traditional\nquark-lepton pairing pattern of three generations of fermions, we explore a\nthree-Higgs-doublet model with Higgs VEVs 246 GeV, 42 GeV and 2.5 GeV which\ncould explain the mass hierarchies of fermions.",

In this paper, we centrally\ndeal with the Hermiticity of quantum operators that directly links to the\nphysical observable, thusly, we give a rigorous proof to verify one-dimensional\nG-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}={{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl\n\\right)\\dagger }}\\in Her$ that is a Hermitian operator satisfying $\\left(\n{{{\\hat{w}}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}\\phi ,\\varphi \\right)=\\left( \\phi\n,{{{\\hat{w}}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}\\varphi \\right)$ for any two states $\\phi$\nand $\\varphi$, and its eigenvalues are real. We also prove that curvature\noperator is a skew-Hermitian operator as well. The act of finishing this\nHermitian proof valuably enables us to ensure the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian\noperator ${{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( ri \\right)}} ={{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( g \\right)}}\n-{{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( \\operatorname{clm} \\right)}}\\in NHer$ that is divided into\nthe Hermitian operator ${{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( g \\right)}} ={{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( cl\n\\right)}}-{{E}^{\\left( s \\right)}}/2\\in Her$ and the skew-Hermitian operator\n${{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( \\operatorname{clm} \\right)}}=\\sqrt{-1}\\hbar\n{{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}\\in SHer$ generally, and ${{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( ri\n\\right)}}$ always has the complex eigenvalues. We use the formula of the\nG-dynamics to evaluate the Berry-Keating's Hamiltonian operator\n${{\\hat{H}}^{\\left( \\text{bk}\\right)}}=-\\sqrt{-1}\\hbar \\hat{\\theta }/2\\in Her$\nand its extensive version $\\hat{H}^{\\left( \\text{gbk}\\right)}\\in NHer$ as the\napplications of the G-dynamics, to see how the similarity appears in the light\nof obvious factor $\\hat{\\theta }/2=x\\frac{d}{dx}+1/2\\in SHer$, etc.",

          "abstract": "Focusing on the algebraical analysis of two various kinds of one-dimensional\nG-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}$ and ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left(\nri\\right)}}$ separately induced by different Hamiltonian operators $\\hat{H} $\nare the keypoints. In this work, it's evidently proved that an identity\n${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}{{u}^{-1/2}}\\equiv0$ always holds for any $u>0$\nbased on the formula of one-dimensional G-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl\n\\right)}}$. We prove that the G-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}$ and\n${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( ri\\right)}}$ obey Leibniz identity if and only if\n${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}1=0$ and ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( ri\\right)}}1=0$,\nrespectively. \\par In accordance with the G-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl\n\\right)}}$, we investigate the unique eigenvalues equation ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left(\ncl \\right)}}L\\left( u,t,\\lambda \\right)=-\\sqrt{-1}\\lambda L\\left( u,t,\\lambda\n\\right)$ of the G-dynamics with a precise geometric eigenfunction $L\\left(\nu,t,\\lambda \\right)={{u}^{-1/2}}{{e}^{{{\\lambda }}t}},~u>0$ as time $t\\in\n\\left[ 0,T \\right]$ develops and the equation of energy spectrum is then\ninduced. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian operators are studied as well, we obtain\na series of ODE with their special solutions, and we prove multiplicative\nproperty of the geometric eigenfunction. The coordinate derivative and time\nevolution of the G-dynamics are respectively considered. Seeking the invariance\nof G-dynamics ${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}$ under coordinate transformation\nis considered, so that we think of one-dimensional G-dynamics\n${{\\hat{w}}^{\\left( cl \\right)}}$ on coordinate transformation, it gives the\nrule of conversion between two coordinate systems. As a application, some\nexamples are given for such rule of conversion. Meanwhile, we search the\nconditions that quantum geometric bracket vanishes and a specific case follows.",
