          "abstract": "The immersed boundary (IB) method is a mathematical framework for\nfluid-structure interaction problems (FSI) that was originally developed to\nsimulate flows around heart valves. Direct comparison of FSI simulations around\nheart valves against experimental data is challenging, however, due to the\ndifficulty of performing robust and effective simulations, the complications of\nmodeling a specific physical experiment, and the need to acquire experimental\ndata that is directly comparable to simulation data. Such comparators are a\nnecessary precursor for further formal validation studies of FSI simulations\ninvolving heart valves. In this work, we performed physical experiments of flow\nthrough a pulmonary valve in an in vitro pulse duplicator, and measured the\ncorresponding velocity field using 4D flow MRI (4-dimensional flow magnetic\nresonance imaging). We constructed a computer model of this pulmonary artery\nsetup, including modeling valve geometry and material properties via a\ntechnique called design-based elasticity, and simulated flow through it with\nthe IB method. The simulated flow fields showed excellent qualitative agreement\nwith experiments, excellent agreement on integral metrics, and reasonable\nrelative error in the entire flow domain and on slices of interest. These\nresults illustrate how to construct a computational model of a physical\nexperiment for use as a comparator.",

          "abstract": "Cardiac fluid dynamics fundamentally involves interactions between complex\nblood flows and the structural deformations of the muscular heart walls and the\nthin, flexible valve leaflets. There has been longstanding scientific,\nengineering, and medical interest in creating mathematical models of the heart\nthat capture, explain, and predict these fluid-structure interactions. However,\nexisting computational models that account for interactions among the blood,\nthe actively contracting myocardium, and the cardiac valves are limited in\ntheir abilities to predict valve performance, resolve fine-scale flow features,\nor use realistic descriptions of tissue biomechanics. Here we introduce and\nbenchmark a comprehensive mathematical model of cardiac fluid dynamics in the\nhuman heart. A unique feature of our model is that it incorporates\nbiomechanically detailed descriptions of all major cardiac structures that are\ncalibrated using tensile tests of human tissue specimens to reflect the heart's\nmicrostructure. Further, it is the first fluid-structure interaction model of\nthe heart that provides anatomically and physiologically detailed\nrepresentations of all four cardiac valves. We demonstrate that this\nintegrative model generates physiologic dynamics, including realistic\npressure-volume loops that automatically capture isovolumetric contraction and\nrelaxation, and predicts fine-scale flow features. None of these outputs are\nprescribed; instead, they emerge from interactions within our comprehensive\ndescription of cardiac physiology. Such models can serve as tools for\npredicting the impacts of medical devices or clinical interventions. They also\ncan serve as platforms for mechanistic studies of cardiac pathophysiology and\ndysfunction, including congenital defects, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure,\nthat are difficult or impossible to perform in patients.",

          "abstract": "Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are born with an\nunderdeveloped left heart. They typically receive a sequence of surgeries that\nresult in a single ventricle physiology called the Fontan circulation. While\nthese patients usually survive into early adulthood, they are at risk for\nmedical complications, partially due to their lower than normal cardiac output,\nwhich leads to insufficient cerebral and gut perfusion. While clinical imaging\ndata can provide detailed insight into cardiovascular function within the\nimaged region, it is difficult to use this data for assessing deficiencies in\nthe rest of the body and for deriving blood pressure dynamics. Data from\npatients used in this paper include three dimensional, magnetic resonance\nangiograms (MRA), time-resolved phase contrast cardiac magnetic resonance\nimages (4D-MRI) and sphygmomanometer blood pressure measurements. The 4D-MRI\nimages provide detailed insight into velocity and flow in vessels within the\nimaged region, but they cannot predict flow in the rest of the body, nor do\nthey provide values of blood pressure. To remedy these limitations, this study\ncombines the MRA, 4D-MRI, and pressure data with 1D fluid dynamics models to\npredict hemodynamics in the major systemic arteries, including the cerebral and\ngut vasculature. To study effects post-surgery we compare simulations for an\nHLHS patient with simulations for a matched control patient that has double\noutlet right ventricle (DORV) physiology with a native aorta. Our results show\nthat the HLHS patient has hypertensive pressures in the brain as well as\nreduced flow to the gut. Wave-intensity analysis suggests that the HLHS patient\nhas irregular circulatory function during light upright exercise conditions and\nthat predicted wall-shear stresses are lower than normal, suggesting the HLHS\npatient may have hypertension.",

The training data set comprises\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice\neyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated\nand untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic\n(a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b)\nsegmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of\ndeep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and\ntesting images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy,\nreliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign\ntumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with\nInception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and\nroot mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive\nperformance indices, respectively.

This\nphenomenon is considered on model system such as wetting of cell aggregate on\nrigid substrate which includes cell aggregate movement and\nisotropic/anisotropic spreading of cell monolayer around the aggregate\ndepending on the substrate rigidity and aggregate size. This model system\naccounts for the transition between 3D epithelial aggregate and 2D cell\nmonolayer as a product of: (1) tissue surface tension, (2) surface tension of\nsubstrate matrix, (3) cell-matrix interfacial tension, (4) interfacial tension\ngradient, (5) viscoelasticity caused by CCM, and (6) viscoelasticity of\nsubstrate matrix. These physical parameters depend on the cell contractility\nand state of cell-cell and cell matrix adhesion contacts, as well as, the\nstretching/compression of cellular systems caused by CCM.

Here, we show that the mode of\ntissue growth is reflected in the size distribution of the progeny of marked\ncells. To this end, we derive the clone-size distributions using analytical\ncalculations in the limit of negligible cell migration and cell death, and we\ntest our predictions with an agent-based stochastic sampling technique. We show\nthat for surface-driven growth the clone-size distribution takes a\ncharacteristic power-law form with an exponent determined by fluctuations of\nthe tissue surface. Our results show how the mode of tissue growth can be\ninferred from genetic tracing experiments.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development\nand homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and\ntumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which\ndescribes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual\ncell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many\nphysiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of\ncontact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance\nof cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is\nstill debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as\nnumerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell\nensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact\ninhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a\nminimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by\nextending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells\nduring growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous\nin-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a\nsystematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell\ndynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of\nemergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective\ncell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the\ntransition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent\nregime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the\nvolume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only\ninter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a\nsize-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed\ncontact inhibition.",

          "abstract": "In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune\nresponse, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines\nlike IL6, mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause\nmultiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to\nidentify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based\non previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell\nco-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy\nagainst progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this\nhypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we\ngenerated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a\nCD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated\nwith COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many\nof the biological processes that have been consistently associated with\nCOVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including\nthe downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous\ntranscriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the\nresponse to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by\nCOVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a\nsignificant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+\nantigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our\nin-silico study provides additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of\nthe CD80/CD86 signaling axis may be protective of the excessive proinflammatory\nstate associated with COVID-19 in the lungs.",

          "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019\nand currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory\nfailure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks\nefficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory\nfailure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike\nprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in\nCOVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified\ntetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating\nlung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene\nexpression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human\nCOVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that\ntwelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515\ncells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,\nincluding signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as\nTNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these\ntwelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such\nas RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of\ntwelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also\nuniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In\nsummary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms\nleading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and\nCGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.",

The vitamin D status of the population has\nbeen found to be an important factor that could influence outcome of COVID-19.\nHowever, whether vitamin D can lessen the symptoms or severity of COVID-19\nstill remains controversial. Methods: A total of 719 patients with confirmed\nCOVID-19 were enrolled retrospectively in this study from April 13 to June 6,\n2022 at Shanghai Forth People's Hospital. The circulating levels of 25(OH)D3,\ninflammatory factors, and clinical parameters were assayed. Time to viral RNA\nclearance (TVRC), classification and prognosis of COVID-19 were used to\nevaluate the severity of COVID-19 infection. Results: The median age was 76\nyears (interquartile range, IQR, 64.5-84.6), 44.1% of patients were male, and\nthe TVRC was 11 days (IQR, 7-16) in this population. The median level of\n25(OH)D3 was 27.15 (IQR, 19.31-38.89) nmol/L. Patients with lower serum\n25(OH)D3 had prolonged time to viral clearance, more obvious inflammatory\nresponse, more severe respiratory symptoms and higher risks of impaired hepatic\nand renal function. Multiple regression analyses revealed that serum 25(OH)D3\nlevel was negatively associated with TVRC independently. ROC curve showed the\nserum vitamin D level could predict the severity classification and prognosis\nof COVID-19 significantly.Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D3 level is independently\nassociated with the severity of COVID-19 in elderly, and it could be used as a\npredictor of the severity of COVID-19. In addition, supplementation with\nvitamin D might provide beneficial effects in old patients with COVID-19.",

The use of CAR T cells to treat B-cell malignancies\n--leukaemias and lymphomas-- is one of the most successful examples, with many\npatients experiencing long-lasting complete responses to this therapy. This\ntreatment works by extracting the patient's T cells and adding them the CAR\ngroup, which enables them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigen\nCD19+, that is expressed in these haematological tumors.\n  Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response of\nleukaemias to the injection of CAR T-cells. The model accounts for mature and\nprogenitor B-cells, tumor cells, CAR T cells and side effects by incorporating\nthe main biological processes involved. The model explains the early\npost-injection dynamics of the different compartments and the fact that the\nnumber of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatment\noutcome. An explicit formula is found that provides the maximum CAR T cell\nexpansion in-vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical model\ncaptures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It also\npredicts that CD19+ tumor relapses could be the result of the competition\nbetween tumor and CAR T cells analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discuss\nthis fact on the light of available evidences and the possibility of\ncontrolling relapses by early re-challenging of the tumor with stored CAR T\ncells.",

Cancer immunotherapies use elements of the patient immune\nsystem to attack tumor cells. One of the most successful types of immunotherapy\nis CAR-T cells. This treatment works by extracting patient's T-cells and adding\nto them an antigen receptor allowing tumor cells to be recognized and targeted.\nThese new cells are called CAR-T cells and are re-infused back into the patient\nafter expansion in-vitro. This approach has been successfully used to treat\nB-cell malignancies (B-cell leukemias and lymphomas). However, its application\nto the treatment of T-cell leukemias faces several problems. One of these is\nfratricide, since the CAR-T cells target both tumor and other CAR-T cells. This\nleads to nonlinear dynamical phenomena amenable to mathematical modeling. In\nthis paper we construct a mathematical model describing the competition of\nCAR-T, tumor and normal T-cells and studied some basic properties of the model\nand its practical implications. Specifically, we found that the model\nreproduced the observed difficulties for in-vitro expansion of the therapeutic\ncells found in the laboratory.

In this study, we present a stochastic agent-based model that\nintegrates cellular heterogeneity, spatial cell-cell interactions, and drug\nresistance evolution to simulate tumor growth and immune response in a\ntwo-dimensional microenvironment. The model captures dynamic behaviors of four\nmajor cell types--tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, and\nregulatory T cells--and incorporates key biological processes such as\nproliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation. Using this\nframework, we simulate tumor progression under different therapeutic\ninterventions, including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint\nblockade. Our simulations reproduce emergent phenomena such as immune privilege\nand spatial immune exclusion. Quantitative analyses show that all therapies\nsuppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor\nmicroenvironment. Notably, combination therapies--especially targeted therapy\nwith immunotherapy--achieve the most effective tumor control and delay the\nemergence of resistance. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal a nonlinear\nrelationship between treatment intensity and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting\nthe existence of optimal dosing thresholds.

The present work investigates a simple yet effective\nphosphate-buffered saline immersion method for achieving polyvinyl alcohol\nbinder removal while enables the maintenance of the mesoporous structure of MBG\n3D-printed scaffolds.
