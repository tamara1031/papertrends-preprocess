To tackle this infodemic, scientific oversight, as well as a\nbetter understanding by practitioners in crisis management, is needed. We have\nconducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of\nmisinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early\ninsights. We have collected all tweets mentioned in the verdicts of\nfact-checked claims related to COVID-19 by over 92 professional fact-checking\norganisations between January and mid-July 2020 and share this corpus with the\ncommunity. This resulted in 1 500 tweets relating to 1 274 false and 276\npartially false claims, respectively. Exploratory analysis of author accounts\nrevealed that the verified twitter handle(including Organisation/celebrity) are\nalso involved in either creating (new tweets) or spreading (retweet) the\nmisinformation. Additionally, we found that false claims propagate faster than\npartially false claims. Compare to a background corpus of COVID-19 tweets,\ntweets with misinformation are more often concerned with discrediting other\ninformation on social media. Authors use less tentative language and appear to\nbe more driven by concerns of potential harm to others. Our results enable us\nto suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic as well as\npropose actions for authorities and social media users to counter\nmisinformation.",

          "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great success in learning from\ngraph-based data. The key mechanism of current GNNs is message passing, where a\nnode's feature is updated based on the information passing from its local\nneighbourhood. A limitation of this mechanism is that node features become\nincreasingly dominated by the information aggregated from the neighbourhood as\nwe use more rounds of message passing. Consequently, as the GNN layers become\ndeeper, adjacent node features tends to be similar, making it more difficult\nfor GNNs to distinguish adjacent nodes, thereby, limiting the performance of\nGNNs. In this paper, we propose conditional local feature encoding (CLFE) to\nhelp prevent the problem of node features being dominated by the information\nfrom local neighbourhood. The idea of our method is to extract the node hidden\nstate embedding from message passing process and concatenate it with the nodes\nfeature from previous stage, then we utilise linear transformation to form a\nCLFE based on the concatenated vector. The CLFE will form the layer output to\nbetter preserve node-specific information, thus help to improve the performance\nof GNN models.

The\nexisting community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on\nonly using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes\nis mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect\nmultipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the\nmodel-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed\nnetworks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as\nbetweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic\nblock model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient\nof nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is\nproposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed\nnetworks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows\nthe Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered\nbased on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and\nclustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and\nattributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is\nemployed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community\nmemberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community\ndetection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing\ndifferent network structures, and comparing with the community detection\nresults of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model\nnot only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect\nvarious network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to\nintroducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes.\nOverall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared\nalgorithms.",

Recently,\nstochastic bounded confidence opinion dynamics were proposed as a general\nframework that incorporates both these dynamics as special cases and also\ncaptures the inherent stochasticity and noise (errors) in real-life social\nexchanges. Although these dynamics are quite general and realistic, their\nanalysis is particularly challenging compared to other opinion dynamics models.\nThis is because these dynamics are nonlinear and stochastic, and belong to the\nclass of Markov processes that have asymptotically zero drift and unbounded\njumps. The asymptotic behavior of these dynamics was characterized in prior\nworks. However, they do not shed light on their finite-time behavior, which is\noften of interest in practice. We take a stride in this direction by analyzing\nthe finite time behavior of a two-agent system, which is fundamental to the\nunderstanding of multi-agent dynamics. In particular, we show that the opinion\ndifference between the two agents is well concentrated around zero under the\nconditions that lead to asymptotic stability of the dynamics.",

For\nnetworks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally\nexponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish\nconditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative\ndominance of the agents at consensus.

We also show -- both numerically and via our\nmean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number\nof dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated.\nOur results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can\nhave important effects on collective opinion dynamics.",

However, analysis at the individual level shows significant\nvariability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of\npreferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In\ncontrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20%\nfollowing PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an\nauthor's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable\nauthors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more\nrandom citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may\ninfluence bibliometric indexes.

It is also the evaluation standard\nfor decision-making such as promotion and allocation of funds. Therefore, how\nto measure the quality of an academic paper is very important. The most common\nstandard for measuring academic papers is the number of citation counts of\npapers, because this indicator is widely used in the evaluation of scientific\npublications, and it also serves as the basis for many other indicators (such\nas the h-index). Therefore, it is very important to be able to accurately\npredict the citation counts of academic papers.\n  This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning network, DeepCCP, which\ncombines the effect of information cascade and looks at the citation counts\nprediction problem from the perspective of information cascade prediction.\nDeepCCP directly uses the citation network formed in the early stage of the\npaper as the input, and the output is the citation counts of the corresponding\npaper after a period of time. DeepCCP only uses the structure and temporal\ninformation of the citation network, and does not require other additional\ninformation, but it can still achieve outstanding performance.

Existing social\nrecommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the\nredundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social\ninfluence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments.\nIn this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named\nCGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social\nnetwork and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More\nspecifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model\n(CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing\nusers' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates\nusers' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the\nweights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity\nbias present in the recommendation model.

However, we argue that not all biases are detrimental,\ni.e., some items recommended by friends may align with the user's interests.\nBlindly eliminating such biases could undermine these positive effects,\npotentially diminishing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nCausal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in\nsocial recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance. From\nthe perspective of causal inference, we find that the user social network could\nbe regarded as a confounder between the user and item embeddings (treatment)\nand ratings (outcome). Due to the presence of this social network confounder,\ntwo paths exist from user and item embeddings to ratings: a non-causal social\ninfluence path and a causal interest path. Building upon this insight, we\npropose a disentangled encoder that focuses on disentangling user and item\nembeddings into interest and social influence embeddings. Mutual\ninformation-based objectives are designed to enhance the distinctiveness of\nthese disentangled embeddings, eliminating redundant information.

Parametrized centralities allow further\nflexibility and utility by tuning the centrality calculation to the regime most\nappropriate for a given network.

However, traditional centrality measures\nsuch as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or PageRank neglect the\ncommunity structure found in real-world networks. To study node importance\nbased on network flows from a mesoscopic perspective, we analytically derive a\ncommunity-aware information-theoretic centrality score based on network flow\nand the coding principles behind the map equation: map equation centrality. Map\nequation centrality measures how much further we can compress the network's\nmodular description by not coding for random walker transitions to the\nrespective node, using an adapted coding scheme and determining node importance\nfrom a network flow-based point of view. The information-theoretic centrality\nmeasure can be determined from a node's local network context alone because\nchanges to the coding scheme only affect other nodes in the same module. Map\nequation centrality is agnostic to the chosen network flow model and allows\nresearchers to select the model that best reflects the dynamics of the process\nunder study. Applied to synthetic networks, we highlight how our approach\nenables a more fine-grained differentiation between nodes than node-local or\nnetwork-global measures. Predicting influential nodes for two different\ndynamical processes on real-world networks with traditional and other\ncommunity-aware centrality measures, we find that activating nodes based on map\nequation centrality scores tends to create the largest cascades in a linear\nthreshold model.",

          "year": "2020-11",
          "abstract": "In complex networks, each node has some unique characteristics that define\nthe importance of the node based on the given application-specific context.\nThese characteristics can be identified using various centrality metrics\ndefined in the literature. Some of these centrality measures can be computed\nusing local information of the node, such as degree centrality and semi-local\ncentrality measure. Others use global information of the network like closeness\ncentrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality,\nPageRank, and so on. In this survey, we discuss these centrality measures and\nthe state of the art literature that includes the extension of centrality\nmeasures to different types of networks, methods to update centrality values in\ndynamic networks, methods to identify top-k nodes, approximation algorithms,\nopen research problems related to the domain, and so on. The paper is concluded\nwith a discussion on application specific centrality measures that will help to\nchoose a centrality measure based on the network type and application\nrequirements.",
