          "abstract": "We consider the problem of data-assisted forecasting of chaotic dynamical\nsystems when the available data is in the form of noisy partial measurements of\nthe past and present state of the dynamical system. Recently there have been\nseveral promising data-driven approaches to forecasting of chaotic dynamical\nsystems using machine learning. Particularly promising among these are hybrid\napproaches that combine machine learning with a knowledge-based model, where a\nmachine-learning technique is used to correct the imperfections in the\nknowledge-based model. Such imperfections may be due to incomplete\nunderstanding and/or limited resolution of the physical processes in the\nunderlying dynamical system, e.g., the atmosphere or the ocean. Previously\nproposed data-driven forecasting approaches tend to require, for training,\nmeasurements of all the variables that are intended to be forecast. We describe\na way to relax this assumption by combining data assimilation with machine\nlearning. We demonstrate this technique using the Ensemble Transform Kalman\nFilter (ETKF) to assimilate synthetic data for the 3-variable Lorenz system and\nfor the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system, simulating model error in each case by a\nmisspecified parameter value. We show that by using partial measurements of the\nstate of the dynamical system, we can train a machine learning model to improve\npredictions made by an imperfect knowledge-based model.",

          "year": "2022-11",
          "abstract": "A common problem in time series analysis is to predict dynamics with only\nscalar or partial observations of the underlying dynamical system. For data on\na smooth compact manifold, Takens theorem proves a time delayed embedding of\nthe partial state is diffeomorphic to the attractor, although for chaotic and\nhighly nonlinear systems learning these delay coordinate mappings is\nchallenging. We utilize deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn\ndiscrete discrete time maps and continuous time flows of the partial state.\nGiven training data for the full state, we also learn a reconstruction map.\nThus, predictions of a time series can be made from the current state and\nseveral previous observations with embedding parameters determined from time\nseries analysis. The state space for time evolution is of comparable dimension\nto reduced order manifold models. These are advantages over recurrent neural\nnetwork models, which require a high dimensional internal state or additional\nmemory terms and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the capacity of deep ANNs to\npredict chaotic behavior from a scalar observation on a manifold of dimension\nthree via the Lorenz system. We also consider multivariate observations on the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where the observation dimension required for\naccurately reproducing dynamics increases with the manifold dimension via the\nspatial extent of the system.",

We show that classical dynamical behavior, as\nquantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics\nof the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with\nregular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising\nfrom chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics.

These optical systems have gained interest in the\nlast two decades due to their compact sizes, unprecedented measurement\ncapabilities, and widespread applications. The increasingly high finesse (or\n$Q$ factor) of such resonators means that nonlinear effects are unavoidable\neven for low power, making them attractive for nonlinear applications,\nincluding optical comb generation and second harmonic generation. In addition,\nlight in these nonlinear resonators may exhibit chaotic behavior across wide\nparameter regions. Hence, it is necessary to understand how, where, and what\ntypes of such chaotic dynamics occur before they can be used in practical\ndevices. We consider a pair of coupled differential equations that describes\nthe interactions of two optical beams in a single-mode resonator with symmetric\npumping. Recently, it was shown that this system exhibits a wide range of\nfascinating behaviors, including bistability, symmetry breaking, chaos, and\nself-switching oscillations. We employ here a dynamical system approach to\nidentify, delimit, and explain the regions where such different behaviors can\nbe observed. Specifically, we find that different kinds of self-switching\noscillations are created via the collision of a pair of asymmetric periodic\norbits or chaotic attractors at Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcations, which acts\nas a gluing bifurcation. We present a bifurcation diagram that shows how these\nglobal bifurcations are organized by a Belyakov transition point (where the\nstability of the homoclinic orbit changes). In this way, we map out distinct\ntransitions to different chaotic switching behavior that should be expected\nfrom this optical device.",

In this study, we numerically evaluate the chaotic\nmode-competition dynamics in a multimode semiconductor laser with optical\nfeedback and injection. We observe the chaotic mode-competition dynamics among\nthe longitudinal modes and control them by injecting an external optical signal\ninto one of the longitudinal modes. We define the dominant mode as the mode\nwith the maximum intensity; the dominant-mode ratio for the injected mode\nincreases as the optical injection strength increases. We find that the\ncharacteristics of the dominant mode ratio in terms of the optical injection\nstrength are different among the modes owing to the different optical feedback\nphases. We propose a control technique for the characteristics of the dominant\nmode ratio by precisely tuning the initial optical frequency detuning between\nthe optical injection signal and injected mode. We also evaluate the\nrelationship between the region for the large dominant mode ratio and injection\nlocking range. The region for the large dominant mode ratio does not correspond\nto the injection-locking range.

Of late,\nthere is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the\nenvironment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are\ninfluenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information\nabout the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like\nusually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by\nthe players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true\nstate erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may\nadopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in\ndifferent perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player\nwould be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an\nincomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we\ncontemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between\nthe frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players\nare equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus.

These models, due to their inherent\nnonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations\nfollow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards\nstochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems\nwith constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with\nchaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory.\nThis study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth\nand death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show\nthat despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic\ndynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its\nstochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the\ndeterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where\nthe term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear\ndynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We\nobserve that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing\ndeterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the\ndynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience\nto demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations,\neven in non-equilibrium dynamics.

Memory, an ability that an agent changes his/her action\ndepending on the history of actions in previous games, is often introduced into\nlearning to explore more clever strategies and discuss the decision-making of\nreal agents like humans. However, such games with memory are hard to analyze\nbecause they exhibit complex phenomena like chaotic dynamics or divergence from\nNash equilibrium. In particular, how asymmetry in memory capacities between\nagents affects learning in games is still unclear. In response, this study\nformulates a gradient ascent algorithm in games with asymmetry memory\ncapacities. To obtain theoretical insights into learning dynamics, we first\nconsider a simple case of zero-sum games. We observe complex behavior, where\nlearning dynamics draw a heteroclinic connection from unstable fixed points to\nstable ones. Despite this complexity, we analyze learning dynamics and prove\nlocal convergence to these stable fixed points, i.e., the Nash equilibria. We\nidentify the mechanism driving this convergence: an agent with a longer memory\nlearns to exploit the other, which in turn endows the other's utility function\nwith strict concavity. We further numerically observe such convergence in\nvarious initial strategies, action numbers, and memory lengths.
