This is in contrast with\nthe torsion case where the situation for simple random walks on Baumslag groups\nis the same as for the lamplighter groups of the same dimension. Our proof uses\nthe realization of the Baumslag group as a linear group. We define and study a\nclass of linear groups associated with multivariable polynomials which we\ndenote $G_k(p)$. We show that the groups $G_3(p)$ have non-trivial Poisson\nboundary for all irreducible finite entropy measures, under a condition on the\npolynomial $p$ which we call the spaced polynomial property. We show that the\nBaumslag group has $G_3(1+x-y)$ as a subgroup, and that the polynomial $p =\n1+x-y$, satisfies this property. Given any upper-triangle group of\ncharacteristic zero, we prove that one of the following must hold: 1) all\nfinite second moment symmetric random walks on $G$ have trivial boundary 2) the\ngroup admits a block, which has a $3$ dimensional wreath product as a subgroup,\nand all non-degenerate random walks on $G$ have non-trivial boundary. 3) $G$\nhas a group $G_3(p)$ as a subgroup. We give a conjectural characterisation of\nall polynomials satisfying the spaced polynomial property. If this is\nconfirmed, our result provides a characterisation of linear groups $G$ which\nadmit a finitely supported symmetric random walk with non-trivial boundary.",

The\ncase $C=\\mathbb{T}$ corresponds to the local $1$-Fourier uniformity conjecture\nof Tao, a central open problem in the study of multiplicative functions with\nfar-reaching number-theoretic applications. We show that the above holds for\nany closed set $C\\subset\\mathbb{T}$ of zero Lebesgue measure. Moreover, we\nprove that extending this to any set $C$ with non-empty interior is equivalent\nto the $C=\\mathbb{T}$ case, which shows that our results are essentially\noptimal without resolving the full conjecture. We also consider higher-order\nvariants. We prove that if the linear phase $e^{2\\pi ih\\alpha}$ is replaced by\na polynomial phase $e^{2\\pi ih^t\\alpha}$ for $t\\geq 2$ then the statement\nremains true for any set $C$ of upper box-counting dimension $<1/t$. The\nstatement also remains true if the supremum over linear phases is replaced with\na supremum over all nilsequences coming form a compact countable ergodic\nsubsets of any $t$-step nilpotent Lie group. Furthermore, we discuss the\nunweighted version of the local $1$-Fourier uniformity problem, showing its\nvalidity for a class of ``rigid'' sets (of full Hausdorff dimension) and\nproving a density result for all closed subsets of zero Lebesgue measure.",

          "year": "2020-11",
          "abstract": "The Furstenberg-S\\'ark\\\"ozy theorem asserts that the difference set $E-E$ of\na subset $E \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ with positive upper density intersects the\nimage set of any polynomial $P \\in \\mathbb{Z}[n]$ for which $P(0)=0$.\nFurstenberg's approach relies on a correspondence principle and a polynomial\nversion of the Poincar\\'e recurrence theorem, which is derived from the\nergodic-theoretic result that for any measure-preserving system\n$(X,\\mathcal{B},\\mu,T)$ and set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $\\mu(A) > 0$, one has\n$c(A):= \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\mu(A \\cap T^{-P(n)}A) >\n0.$ The limit $c(A)$ will have its optimal value of $\\mu(A)^2$ when $T$ is\ntotally ergodic. Motivated by the possibility of new combinatorial\napplications, we define the notion of asymptotic total ergodicity in the\nsetting of modular rings $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$. We show that a sequence of\nmodular rings $\\mathbb{Z}/N_m\\mathbb{Z}$, $m \\in \\mathbb{N},$ is asymptotically\ntotally ergodic if and only if $\\mathrm{lpf}(N_m)$, the least prime factor of\n$N_m$, grows to infinity. From this fact, we derive some combinatorial\nconsequences, for example the following.

With the recent success of deep learning, there is\nincreasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in\na data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific\ntypes of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training.\nThis restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data\nis often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-modal foundation model, named \\textbf{FMint} (\\textbf{F}oundation\n\\textbf{M}odel based on \\textbf{In}i\\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap\nbetween human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of\ndynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with\nin-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a\nuniversal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted\nsequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is\npre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on\nchallenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both\naccuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting\nFMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems.

Through the analytical\nresults and case studies alongside numerical simulations, we find that the\ninitial mass of the invasive prey species, capture rates of prey species, and\nthe predator's mortality rate are all important factors determining the\nsuccess/failure of invasions and the species coexistence/extinction. The global\ndynamics can be completely classified for the Holling type I functional\nresponse function, but can only be partially determined for the Holling type II\nfunctional response function. For the Holling type I response function, we find\nthat whether the invasive prey species can successfully invade to promote the\npredator-mediated apparent competition is entirely determined by the capture\nrates of prey species. If the Holling type II response function is applied,\nthen the dynamics are more complicated. First, if two prey species have the\nsame ecological characteristics, then the initial mass of the invasive prey\nspecies is the key factor determining the success/failure of the invasion and\nhence the effect of the predator-mediated apparent competition. Whereas if two\nprey species have different ecological characteristics, say different capture\nrates, then the success of the invasion no longer depends on the initial mass\nof the invasive prey species, but on the capture rates. In all cases, if the\ninvasion succeeds, then the predator-mediated apparent competition's\neffectiveness essentially depends on the predator's mortality rate.",

In this study,\nwe extend this approach to derive positive steady states in networks under\nnon-mass-action kinetics, specifically mixed kinetics. In a system with mixed\nkinetics, some reactions {may follow} mass-action kinetics, while others in the\nsame network follow different rate laws, such as quotient rate laws.
