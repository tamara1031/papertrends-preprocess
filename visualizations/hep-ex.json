There is\nmore than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter including\nthe two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter\nspecies(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter\nparticles (subdominant) in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter\nspecies is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves\n(semi)relativistic velocity or {\\it boost}. These boosted dark matter particles\nsuffer from scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere\nand the Earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the\nkinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two-component dark\nmatter framework, we examine how the boost of the dark matter influences the\nattenuation of kinetic energy across a broad spectrum of dark matter masses. We\nperform a detailed study at various DM-electron and DM-nucleus cross sections\nincluding the effect of nuclear form factor and elastic and inelastic\nscattering (for large kinetic energy).

The linear\ncolliders proposed consist of options for the International Linear Collider\n(ILC), for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), for the Cold Copper Collider\n(C^3), and for the more recent Higgs-Energy Lepton Collider (HELEN). ERLs are\nkey components of the Recycling Linear e+e- Collider (ReLiC), of the Energy\nRecovery Linear Collider (ERLC), and of the Circular Energy Recovery Collider\n(CERC). Among the more conventional ring colliders, the following proposals are\nfeatured: the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee), the Circular Electron Positron\nCollider (CEPC), the Electron Positron Circular Collider at Fermilab (EPCCF),\nand the Large Electron Positron collider $\\#$3 (LEP-3). In addition, we\nconsider the X-ray FEL based gamma-gamma Collider Higgs Factory (XCC) and the\nHigh-Energy High-Luminosity gamma-gamma collider (HE&HL gamma-gamma). Finally,\na Higgs factory based on a circular muon collider is mentioned for\ncompleteness.",

This report describes the FCC\nintegrated programme, which consists of two stages: an electron-positron\ncollider (FCC-ee) in the first phase, serving as a high-luminosity Higgs, top,\nand electroweak factory; followed by a proton-proton collider (FCC-hh) at the\nenergy frontier in the second phase.\n  FCC-ee is designed to operate at four key centre-of-mass energies: the Z\npole, the WW production threshold, the ZH production peak, and the top/anti-top\nproduction threshold - delivering the highest possible luminosities to four\nexperiments. Over 15 years of operation, FCC-ee will produce more than 6\ntrillion Z bosons, 200 million WW pairs, nearly 3 million Higgs bosons, and 2\nmillion top anti-top pairs. Precise energy calibration at the Z pole and WW\nthreshold will be achieved through frequent resonant depolarisation of pilot\nbunches. The sequence of operation modes remains flexible.\n  FCC-hh will operate at a centre-of-mass energy of approximately 85 TeV -\nnearly an order of magnitude higher than the LHC - and is designed to deliver 5\nto 10 times the integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC. Its mass reach for direct\ndiscovery extends to several tens of TeV. In addition to proton-proton\ncollisions, FCC-hh is capable of supporting ion-ion, ion-proton, and\nlepton-hadron collision modes.\n  This second volume of the Feasibility Study Report presents the complete\ndesign of the FCC-ee collider, its operation and staging strategy, the\nfull-energy booster and injector complex, required accelerator technologies,\nsafety concepts, and technical infrastructure. It also includes the design of\nthe FCC-hh hadron collider, development of high-field magnets, hadron injector\noptions, and key technical systems for FCC-hh.",

The measurements are performed with ALICE at the\nLHC. Different multiplicity classes are defined based on the event activity\nmeasured at forward rapidities. The hard scatterings are identified by the\nleading particle defined as the charged particle with the largest transverse\nmomentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) in the collision and having $8 < p_{\\rm T} < 15$\nGeV/$c$. The $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra of associated particles ($0.5 \\leq p_{\\rm\nT}<6$ GeV/$c$) are measured in different azimuthal regions defined with respect\nto the leading particle direction: toward, transverse, and away. The associated\ncharged particle yields in the transverse region are subtracted from those of\nthe away and toward regions. The remaining jet-like yields are reported as a\nfunction of the multiplicity measured in the transverse region. The\nmeasurements show a suppression of the jet-like yield in the away region and an\nenhancement of high-$p_{\\rm T}$ associated particles in the toward region in\ncentral Pb$-$Pb collisions, as compared to minimum-bias pp collisions. These\nobservations are consistent with previous measurements that used two-particle\ncorrelations, and with an interpretation in terms of parton energy loss in a\nhigh-density quark gluon plasma. These yield modifications vanish in peripheral\nPb$-$Pb collisions and are not observed in either high-multiplicity pp or\np$-$Pb collisions.",
