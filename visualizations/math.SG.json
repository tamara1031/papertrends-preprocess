These are submersions\nwhose total space carries a Poisson structure, on which the ambient Poisson\nstructure pulls back, as a Dirac structure, to Poisson structures on each\nindividual fibre. Our ``Poisson-Dirac viewpoint'' is prompted by natural\nexamples of Poisson submersions with Poisson fibers -- in toric geometry and\nPoisson-Lie groups -- whose analysis was not possible using the existing tools\nin the Poisson literature.\n  The first part of the paper studies the Poisson-Dirac perspective of inducing\nPoisson structures on submanifolds. This is a rich landscape, in which subtle\nbehaviours abound -- as illustrated by a surprising ``jumping phenomenon''\nconcerning the complex relation between the induced and the ambient symplectic\nfoliations, which we discovered here. These pathologies, however, are absent\nfrom the well-behaved and abundant class of \\emph{coregular} submanifolds, with\nwhich we are mostly concerned here.\n  The second part of the paper studies Poisson submersions with Poisson fibres\n-- the natural Poisson generalization of flat symplectic bundles. These Poisson\nsubmersions have coregular Poisson-Dirac fibres, and behave functorially with\nrespect to such submanifolds. We discuss the subtle collective behavior of the\nPoisson fibers of such Poisson fibrations, and explain their relation to\npencils of Poisson structures.\n  The third and final part applies the theory developed to Poisson submersions\nwith Poisson fibres which arise in Lie theory. We also show that such\nsubmersions are a convenient setting for the associated bundle construction,\nand we illustrate this by producing new Poisson structures with a finite number\nof symplectic leaves.\n  Some of the points in the paper being fairly new, we illustrate the many fine\nissues that appear with an abundance of (counter-)examples.",

Moreover, with\nthe geometric machinery, the phase space of a mechanical system with symmetries\ncan be reduced to a space with less dimensions. As it is well-known,\nnon-conservative forces cannot be written as the gradient of a potential, so\nthey cannot be absorbed in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. The description of a\nmechanical system subject to a non-conservative force requires an external\nforce together with the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function. In addition,\nexternal forces emerge for the description of certain systems with\nnon-holonomic constraints.\n  In this master's thesis, autonomous Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems are\nstudied in the framework of symplectic geometry. After introducing the\ngeometric tools that will be employed, several results regarding symmetries and\nconstants of the motion are reviewed. The method of symplectic reduction for\nsystems with symmetry is also presented. In a second part, non-conservative\nsystems are presented in a geometric language. A Noether's theorem for\nLagrangian systems subject to external forces is obtained. Other results\nregarding symmetries and constants of the motion are derived as well.\nFurthermore, a theory for the reduction of forced Lagrangian systems invariant\nunder the action of a Lie group is presented.

The natural\nquestion is, can an analogous distance in the contact realm be defined?

In this work, we do something\nsimilar, yet the distance we define is less restrictive.
