          "abstract": "This paper presents a novel multistage fine-tuning strategy designed to\nenhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance in low-resource\nlanguages using OpenAI's Whisper model. In this approach we aim to build ASR\nmodel for languages with limited digital resources by sequentially adapting the\nmodel across linguistically similar languages. We experimented this on the\nMalasar language, a Dravidian language spoken by approximately ten thousand\npeople in the Western Ghats of South India. Malasar language faces critical\nchallenges for technological intervention due to its lack of a native script\nand absence of digital or spoken data resources. Working in collaboration with\nWycliffe India and Malasar community members, we created a spoken Malasar\ncorpus paired with transcription in Tamil script, a closely related major\nlanguage. In our approach to build ASR model for Malasar, we first build an\nintermediate Tamil ASR, leveraging higher data availability for Tamil annotated\nspeech. This intermediate model is subsequently fine-tuned on Malasar data,\nallowing for more effective ASR adaptation despite limited resources. The\nmultistage fine-tuning strategy demonstrated significant improvements over\ndirect fine-tuning on Malasar data alone, achieving a word error rate (WER) of\n51.9%, which is 4.5% absolute reduction when compared to the direct fine-tuning\nmethod. Further a WER reduction to 47.3% was achieved through punctuation\nremoval in post-processing, which addresses formatting inconsistencies that\nimpact evaluation. Our results underscore the effectiveness of sequential\nmultistage fine-tuning combined with targeted post-processing as a scalable\nstrategy for ASR system development in low-resource languages, especially where\nlinguistic similarities can be leveraged to bridge gaps in training data.",

However, even though the average accuracy of these systems may be\nhigh, the performance on rare content words often lags behind hybrid ASR\nsystems. To address this problem, second-pass rescoring is often applied\nleveraging upon language modeling. In this paper, we propose a second-pass\nsystem with multi-task learning, utilizing semantic targets (such as intent and\nslot prediction) to improve speech recognition performance. We show that our\nrescoring model trained with these additional tasks outperforms the baseline\nrescoring model, trained with only the language modeling task, by 1.4% on a\ngeneral test and by 2.6% on a rare word test set in terms of word-error-rate\nrelative (WERR).

Over time, each\nlanguage has adopted words from other languages, such as English, leading to\ncode-mixing. Most Indian languages also have their own unique scripts, which\nposes a major limitation in training multilingual and code-switching ASR\nsystems.\n  Inspired by results in text-to-speech synthesis, in this work, we use an\nin-house rule-based phoneme-level common label set (CLS) representation to\ntrain multilingual and code-switching ASR for Indian languages. We propose two\nend-to-end (E2E) ASR systems. In the first system, the E2E model is trained on\nthe CLS representation, and we use a novel data-driven back-end to recover the\nnative language script. In the second system, we propose a modification to the\nE2E model, wherein the CLS representation and the native language characters\nare used simultaneously for training. We show our results on the multilingual\nand code-switching tasks of the Indic ASR Challenge 2021.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel approach using a Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) augmented with an additional control branch using ControlNet.\nThis allows for long-form and variable-length music generation and editing\ncontrolled by text and melody prompts. For more precise and fine-grained melody\ncontrol, we introduce a novel top-$k$ constant-Q Transform representation as\nthe melody prompt, reducing ambiguity compared to previous representations\n(e.g., chroma), particularly for music with multiple tracks or a wide range of\npitch values. To effectively balance the control signals from text and melody\nprompts, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy that progressively masks the\nmelody prompt, resulting in a more stable training process. Experiments have\nbeen performed on text-to-music generation and music-style transfer tasks using\nopen-source instrumental recording data. The results demonstrate that by\nextending StableAudio, a pre-trained text-controlled DiT model, our approach\nenables superior melody-controlled editing while retaining good text-to-music\ngeneration performance. These results outperform a strong MusicGen baseline in\nterms of both text-based generation and melody preservation for editing.

          "abstract": "Deep neural network-based systems have significantly improved the performance\nof speaker diarization tasks. However, end-to-end neural diarization (EEND)\nsystems often struggle to generalize to scenarios with an unseen number of\nspeakers, while target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) systems tend\nto be overly complex. In this paper, we propose a simple attention-based\nencoder-decoder network for end-to-end neural diarization (AED-EEND). In our\ntraining process, we introduce a teacher-forcing strategy to address the\nspeaker permutation problem, leading to faster model convergence. For\nevaluation, we propose an iterative decoding method that outputs diarization\nresults for each speaker sequentially. Additionally, we propose an Enhancer\nmodule to enhance the frame-level speaker embeddings, enabling the model to\nhandle scenarios with an unseen number of speakers. We also explore replacing\nthe transformer encoder with a Conformer architecture, which better models\nlocal information. Furthermore, we discovered that commonly used simulation\ndatasets for speaker diarization have a much higher overlap ratio compared to\nreal data. We found that using simulated training data that is more consistent\nwith real data can achieve an improvement in consistency. Extensive\nexperimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethodologies.

          "abstract": "The most common approach to speaker diarization is clustering of speaker\nembeddings. However, the clustering-based approach has a number of problems;\ni.e., (i) it is not optimized to minimize diarization errors directly, (ii) it\ncannot handle speaker overlaps correctly, and (iii) it has trouble adapting\ntheir speaker embedding models to real audio recordings with speaker overlaps.\nTo solve these problems, we propose the End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND),\nin which a neural network directly outputs speaker diarization results given a\nmulti-speaker recording. To realize such an end-to-end model, we formulate the\nspeaker diarization problem as a multi-label classification problem and\nintroduce a permutation-free objective function to directly minimize\ndiarization errors. Besides its end-to-end simplicity, the EEND method can\nexplicitly handle speaker overlaps during training and inference. Just by\nfeeding multi-speaker recordings with corresponding speaker segment labels, our\nmodel can be easily adapted to real conversations. We evaluated our method on\nsimulated speech mixtures and real conversation datasets. The results showed\nthat the EEND method outperformed the state-of-the-art x-vector\nclustering-based method, while it correctly handled speaker overlaps. We\nexplored the neural network architecture for the EEND method, and found that\nthe self-attention-based neural network was the key to achieving excellent\nperformance. In contrast to conditioning the network only on its previous and\nnext hidden states, as is done using bidirectional long short-term memory\n(BLSTM), self-attention is directly conditioned on all the frames. By\nvisualizing the attention weights, we show that self-attention captures global\nspeaker characteristics in addition to local speech activity dynamics, making\nit especially suitable for dealing with the speaker diarization problem.",

However, most methods\nencounter difficulties in detecting unknown attacks in practical use, which\noften have different statistical distributions from known attacks. Especially,\nthe fast development of synthetic voice spoofing algorithms is generating\nincreasingly powerful attacks, putting the ASV systems at risk of unseen\nattacks. In this work, we propose an anti-spoofing system to detect unknown\nsynthetic voice spoofing attacks (i.e., text-to-speech or voice conversion)\nusing one-class learning. The key idea is to compact the bona fide speech\nrepresentation and inject an angular margin to separate the spoofing attacks in\nthe embedding space. Without resorting to any data augmentation methods, our\nproposed system achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 2.19% on the evaluation\nset of ASVspoof 2019 Challenge logical access scenario, outperforming all\nexisting single systems (i.e., those without model ensemble).",

However, the sound\ndurations of sound events vary greatly depending on the sound event class,\ne.g., the sound event ``fan'' has a long time duration, while the sound event\n``mouse clicking'' is instantaneous. The difference in the time duration\nbetween sound event classes thus causes a serious data imbalance problem in\nSED. In this paper, we propose a method for SED using a duration robust loss\nfunction, which can focus model training on sound events of short duration. In\nthe proposed method, we focus on a relationship between the duration of the\nsound event and the ease/difficulty of model training. In particular, many\nsound events of long duration (e.g., sound event ``fan'') are stationary\nsounds, which have less variation in their acoustic features and their model\ntraining is easy. Meanwhile, some sound events of short duration (e.g., sound\nevent ``object impact'') have more than one audio pattern, such as attack,\ndecay, and release parts.

However, the inherited iterative\nsampling process costs hinder their applications to text-to-speech deployment.\nThrough the preliminary study on diffusion model parameterization, we find that\nprevious gradient-based TTS models require hundreds or thousands of iterations\nto guarantee high sample quality, which poses a challenge for accelerating\nsampling. In this work, we propose ProDiff, on progressive fast diffusion model\nfor high-quality text-to-speech. Unlike previous work estimating the gradient\nfor data density, ProDiff parameterizes the denoising model by directly\npredicting clean data to avoid distinct quality degradation in accelerating\nsampling. To tackle the model convergence challenge with decreased diffusion\niterations, ProDiff reduces the data variance in the target site via knowledge\ndistillation. Specifically, the denoising model uses the generated\nmel-spectrogram from an N-step DDIM teacher as the training target and distills\nthe behavior into a new model with N/2 steps. As such, it allows the TTS model\nto make sharp predictions and further reduces the sampling time by orders of\nmagnitude. Our evaluation demonstrates that ProDiff needs only 2 iterations to\nsynthesize high-fidelity mel-spectrograms, while it maintains sample quality\nand diversity competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps.\nProDiff enables a sampling speed of 24x faster than real-time on a single\nNVIDIA 2080Ti GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to\ntext-to-speech synthesis deployment for the first time. Our extensive ablation\nstudies demonstrate that each design in ProDiff is effective, and we further\nshow that ProDiff can be easily extended to the multi-speaker setting.

In this paper, we propose a \"Co\"nsistency \"Mo\"del-based\n\"Speech\" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a\nsingle diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The\nconsistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a\nwell-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior\nperformances in the distilled CoMoSpeech.

          "abstract": "While previous speech-driven talking face generation methods have made\nsignificant progress in improving the visual quality and lip-sync quality of\nthe synthesized videos, they pay less attention to lip motion jitters which\ngreatly undermine the realness of talking face videos. What causes motion\njitters, and how to mitigate the problem? In this paper, we conduct systematic\nanalyses on the motion jittering problem based on a state-of-the-art pipeline\nthat uses 3D face representations to bridge the input audio and output video,\nand improve the motion stability with a series of effective designs. We find\nthat several issues can lead to jitters in synthesized talking face video: 1)\njitters from the input 3D face representations; 2) training-inference mismatch;\n3) lack of dependency modeling among video frames. Accordingly, we propose\nthree effective solutions to address this issue: 1) we propose a gaussian-based\nadaptive smoothing module to smooth the 3D face representations to eliminate\njitters in the input; 2) we add augmented erosions on the input data of the\nneural renderer in training to simulate the distortion in inference to reduce\nmismatch; 3) we develop an audio-fused transformer generator to model\ndependency among video frames. Besides, considering there is no off-the-shelf\nmetric for measuring motion jitters in talking face video, we devise an\nobjective metric (Motion Stability Index, MSI), to quantitatively measure the\nmotion jitters by calculating the reciprocal of variance acceleration.\nExtensive experimental results show the superiority of our method on\nmotion-stable face video generation, with better quality than previous systems.",

          "year": "2023-03",
          "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D face animation aims to generate realistic facial expressions\nthat match the speech content and emotion. However, existing methods often\nneglect emotional facial expressions or fail to disentangle them from speech\ncontent. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end neural\nnetwork to disentangle different emotions in speech so as to generate rich 3D\nfacial expressions. Specifically, we introduce the emotion disentangling\nencoder (EDE) to disentangle the emotion and content in the speech by\ncross-reconstructed speech signals with different emotion labels. Then an\nemotion-guided feature fusion decoder is employed to generate a 3D talking face\nwith enhanced emotion. The decoder is driven by the disentangled identity,\nemotional, and content embeddings so as to generate controllable personal and\nemotional styles. Finally, considering the scarcity of the 3D emotional talking\nface data, we resort to the supervision of facial blendshapes, which enables\nthe reconstruction of plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional data, and contribute\na large-scale 3D emotional talking face dataset (3D-ETF) to train the network.\nOur experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods and exhibits more diverse facial movements.

          "abstract": "Automatically generating videos in which synthesized speech is synchronized\nwith lip movements in a talking head has great potential in many human-computer\ninteraction scenarios. In this paper, we present an automatic method to\ngenerate synchronized speech and talking-head videos on the basis of text and a\nsingle face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous\ntext-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the\nvoice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing\nspeech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,\nthe proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and\ntalking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a\nspeech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a\nface-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity\ninformation from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a\npersonalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the\ntalking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that\ncan predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate\nsynchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and\nnon-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding\nto the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the\nproposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlandmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.",

          "abstract": "Unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) aims to detect unknown anomalous\nsounds of devices when only normal sound data is available. The autoencoder\n(AE) and self-supervised learning based methods are two mainstream methods.\nHowever, the AE-based methods could be limited as the feature learned from\nnormal sounds can also fit with anomalous sounds, reducing the ability of the\nmodel in detecting anomalies from sound. The self-supervised methods are not\nalways stable and perform differently, even for machines of the same type. In\naddition, the anomalous sound may be short-lived, making it even harder to\ndistinguish from normal sound. This paper proposes an ID constrained\nTransformer-based autoencoder (IDC-TransAE) architecture with weighted anomaly\nscore computation for unsupervised ASD. Machine ID is employed to constrain the\nlatent space of the Transformer-based autoencoder (TransAE) by introducing a\nsimple ID classifier to learn the difference in the distribution for the same\nmachine type and enhance the ability of the model in distinguishing anomalous\nsound. Moreover, weighted anomaly score computation is introduced to highlight\nthe anomaly scores of anomalous events that only appear for a short time.\nExperiments performed on DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 development dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

However, these anomalous sounds\nof machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models\nemployed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for\ntraining, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we\npropose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect\nanomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic\nfeatures into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency\nmodeling. DPT blocks use attention modules to alternately model the interactive\ninformation about the frequency and temporal components of the segmented\nacoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt\na self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound.\nSpecifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic\nfeatures, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the\nperformance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the\nDCASE2021 task2 dataset. The experimental results show that the SSDPT network\nachieves a significant increase in the harmonic mean AUC score, in comparison\nto present state-of-the-art methods of anomalous sound detection.",

          "abstract": "Assessing the naturalness of speech using mean opinion score (MOS) prediction\nmodels has positive implications for the automatic evaluation of speech\nsynthesis systems. Early MOS prediction models took the raw waveform or\namplitude spectrum of speech as input, whereas more advanced methods employed\nself-supervised-learning (SSL) based models to extract semantic representations\nfrom speech for MOS prediction. These methods utilized limited aspects of\nspeech information for MOS prediction, resulting in restricted prediction\naccuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAMOS, a MOS prediction model\nthat leverages both Semantic and Acoustic information of speech to be assessed.\nSpecifically, the proposed SAMOS leverages a pretrained wav2vec2 to extract\nsemantic representations and uses the feature extractor of a pretrained\nBiVocoder to extract acoustic features. These two types of features are then\nfed into the prediction network, which includes multi-task heads and an\naggregation layer, to obtain the final MOS score.

Recently,\nneural-based SQA models have been actively developed for speech samples\nproduced by text-to-speech or voice conversion, with a primary focus on\ntraining mean opinion score (MOS) prediction models. The quality of each speech\nsample may not be consistent across the entire duration, and it remains unclear\nwhich segments of the speech receive the primary focus from humans when\nassigning subjective evaluation for MOS calculation. We hypothesize that when\nhumans rate speech, they tend to assign more weight to low-quality speech\nsegments, and the variance in ratings for each sample is mainly due to\naccidental assignment of higher scores when overlooking the poor quality speech\nsegments. Motivated by the hypothesis, we analyze the VCC2018 and BVCC\ndatasets. Based on the hypothesis, we propose the more reliable representative\nvalue N_low-MOS, the mean of the $N$-lowest opinion scores. Our experiments\nshow that LCC and SRCC improve compared to regular MOS when employing N_low-MOS\nto MOSNet training.
