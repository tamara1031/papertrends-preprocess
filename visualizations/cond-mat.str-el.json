A way to clarify the origin of the QSL\nstate in these systems is to identify ways to tune them from the putative QSL\nstate towards long-range magnetic order. Here, we introduce the Ce-based TLAF\nKCeS$_2$ and show via low-temperature specific heat and $\\mu$SR investigations\nthat it yields magnetic order below $T_{\\mathrm N} = 0.38$ K despite the same\ndelafossite structure. We identify a well separated ${\\tilde S} = 1/2$ ground\nstate for KCeS$_2$ from inelastic neutron scattering and embedded-cluster\nquantum chemical calculations. Magnetization and electron spin resonance\nmeasurements on single crystals indicate a strong easy-plane $g$~factor\nanisotropy, in agreement with the ab initio calculations. Finally, our\nspecific-heat studies reveal an in-plane anisotropy of the magnetic\nfield-temperature phase diagram which may indicate anisotropic magnetic\ninteractions in KCeS$_2$.",

          "abstract": "The 3$d$-5$d$ based double perovskites offer an ideal playground to study the\ninterplay between electron correlation ($U$) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\neffect, showing exotic physics. The Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ is an interesting member in\nthis family with ionic distribution of Fe$^{3+}$ (3$d^5$) and Ir$^{5+}$\n(5$d^4$) where the later is believed to be nonmagnetic under the picture of\nstrong SOC. Here, we report detailed investigation of structural, magnetic and\nelectronic transport properties along with electronic structure calculations in\n(Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$ series with $x$ from 0 to 1. While the basic\ninteractions such as, $U$ and SOC are unlikely to be modified but a structural\nmodification is expected due to ionic size difference between Sr$^{2+}$ and\nCa$^{2+}$ which would influence other properties such as crystal field effect\nand band widths. While a nonmonotonic changes in lattice parameters are\nobserved across the series, the spectroscopic investigations reveal that 3+/5+\ncharge state of Fe/Ir continue till end of the series. An analysis of magnetic\ndata suggests similar nonmonotonic evolution of magnetic parameters with\ndoping. Temperature dependent crystal structure as well as low temperature (5\nK) magnetic structure have been determined from neutron powder diffraction\nmeasurements. The whole series shows insulating behavior. The electronic\nstructure calculations show, SOC enhanced, a noncollinear antiferromagnetic and\nMott-type insulating state is the stable ground state for present series with a\nsubstantial amount of orbital moment, but less than the spin magnetic moment,\nat the Ir site and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The obtained results\nimply that the Ca$^{2+}$ has large influence on the magnetic and transport\nproperties, further showing a large agreement between experimental results as\nwell as theoretical calculations.",

          "abstract": "The rare-earth perovskite TbScO$_3$ has been widely used as a substrate for\nthe growth of epitaxial ferroelectric and multiferroic thin films, while its\ndetailed low-temperature magnetic properties were rarely reported. In this\npaper, we performed detailed magnetization, specific heat and single crystal\nneutron scattering measurements, along with the crystalline electric field\ncalculations to study the low-temperature magnetic properties of TbScO$_3$. All\nour results suggest the magnetic Tb$^{3+}$ has an Ising-like pseudo-doublet\nground state at low temperatures. Due to the constrain of local point symmetry,\nthese Tb$^{3+}$ Ising moments are confined in the $ab$ plane with a tilt angle\nof $\\varphi = \\pm48^{\\mathrm{o}}$ to the $a$ axis. In zero field, the system\nundergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_{\\mathrm{N}}=2.53$ K, and\nforms a $G_xA_y$ noncollinear magnetic structure below $T_{\\mathrm{N}}$. We\nfind the dipole-dipole interactions play an important role to determine the\nmagnetic ground state, which are also responsible for the quasi-one-dimensional\nmagnetism in TbScO$_3$. The significant anisotropic diffuse scatterings further\nconfirm the quasi-one-dimensional magnetism along the $c$ axis. The magnetic\nphase diagram with the field along the easy $b$ axis is well established. In\naddition to the $G_xA_y$ antiferromagnetic state, there is an exotic\nfield-induced phase emerged near the critical field $B_{\\mathrm{c}}\\simeq0.7$\nT, where three-dimensional magnetic order is suppressed but strong\none-dimensional correlations may still exist.",

Taking into\naccount two types of the magnetic anisotropy, single-ion anisotropy and\nbond-dependent anisotropy, we elucidate magnetic phase diagrams for an\narchetypal triangular-lattice system in the absence and presence of an external\nmagnetic field. In the case of the single-ion anisotropy, we find a plethora of\nmultiple-$Q$ instabilities depending on the strength and the sign of the\nanisotropy (easy plane or easy axis), including a skyrmion crystal with\ntopological number of two. In an external magnetic field, we find that a\nskyrmion crystal with topological number of one is stabilized by the in-plane\n(out-of-plane) magnetic field under the easy-plane (easy-axis) anisotropy. We\nalso examine the stability of the field-induced skyrmion crystal by rotating\nthe field direction. As a biproduct, we show that a triple-$Q$ state with\nnonzero chirality appears in the presence of the biquadratic interaction and\nthe easy-axis anisotropy. Meanwhile, we find that the bond-dependent anisotropy\nalso stabilizes both types of skyrmion crystals. We show that, however, for the\nskyrmion crystal with topological number of one, Bloch- and N\\'eel-type\nskyrmion crystals are selectively realized depending on the sign of the\nbond-dependent anisotropy. Moreover, we find yet another multiple-$Q$ states,\nincluding two types of meron crystals with the skyrmion numbers of one and two.\nThe systematic investigation will provide a reference to complex magnetic\ntextures in centrosymmetric magnetic metals.",

These\ncircuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete\nfixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and\nhigher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian\nDijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime\nrepresentation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are\nbased on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code,\ninto which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The\noverhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known\nconstructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures\nfor the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum\ncomputation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement\ntwisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further\nresult, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli)\nnoise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form\nsymmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper\nas well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based\ntopological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also\ndemonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits\nfor specific non-Abelian phases.

Specifically, we construct\nconcrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local\nquantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement,\nwhich manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the\ntopological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the\ngapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states\nrepresent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no\ncounterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form\nsymmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state\ntopological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as\nanother key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and\ncharacterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states\nare clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding\nstatistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth\nlocal quantum channels from any bipartite separable states.

Our framework categorizes topological orders in mixed\nstates as either quantum, classical, or trivial, depending on the type of\ninformation that can be encoded. For the case of the toric code model in the\npresence of decoherence, we associate for each phase a quantum channel and\ndescribes the structure of the code space.
