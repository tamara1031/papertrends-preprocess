          "year": "2024-12",
          "abstract": "Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science\nto decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown\nsignificant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no\ndata-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of\ntraditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven\nnumerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their\nspatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean\nneural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean\nInternational. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical\nreanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural\noperators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions\nwithin a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and\nefficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against\ntwo other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and\nforecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent\nneural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive\nvalidation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based\nocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error\nassessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily\nto minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising\nresults, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents.\nGLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European\nDigital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.",

          "abstract": "A data-driven model (DDM) suitable for regional weather forecasting\napplications is presented. The model extends the Artificial Intelligence\nForecasting System by introducing a stretched-grid architecture that dedicates\nhigher resolution over a regional area of interest and maintains a lower\nresolution elsewhere on the globe. The model is based on graph neural networks,\nwhich naturally affords arbitrary multi-resolution grid configurations.\n  The model is applied to short-range weather prediction for the Nordics,\nproducing forecasts at 2.5 km spatial and 6 h temporal resolution. The model is\npre-trained on 43 years of global ERA5 data at 31 km resolution and is further\nrefined using 3.3 years of 2.5 km resolution operational analyses from the\nMetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS). The performance of the model is\nevaluated using surface observations from measurement stations across Norway\nand is compared to short-range weather forecasts from MEPS. The DDM outperforms\nboth the control run and the ensemble mean of MEPS for 2 m temperature. The\nmodel also produces competitive precipitation and wind speed forecasts, but is\nshown to underestimate extreme events.",

          "year": "2020-03",
          "abstract": "We present a significantly-improved data-driven global weather forecasting\nframework using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to forecast several\nbasic atmospheric variables on a global grid. New developments in this\nframework include an offline volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere\ngrid, improvements to the CNN architecture, and the minimization of the loss\nfunction over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere\nremapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution\noperations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding\nin the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely\nstable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks\nand longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly\noutperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are\nworse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP\nsystem. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface\ntemperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time\nscales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the\nprescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it is\ncurrently less accurate than operational weather forecasting models, our\ndata-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine\nlearning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.",

          "abstract": "El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most prominent interannual\nclimate variability in the tropics and exhibits diverse features in\nspatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, a simple multiscale intermediate\ncoupled stochastic model is developed to capture the ENSO diversity and\ncomplexity. The model starts with a deterministic and linear coupled\ninterannual atmosphere, ocean and sea surface temperature (SST) system. It can\ngenerate two distinct dominant linear solutions that represent the eastern\nPacific (EP) and the central Pacific (CP) El Ni\\~nos, respectively. In addition\nto adopting a stochastic model for characterizing the intraseasonal wind\nbursts, another simple stochastic process is developed to describe the decadal\nvariation of the background Walker circulation. The latter links the two\ndominant modes in a simple nonlinear fashion and advances the modulation of the\nstrength and occurrence frequency of the EP and the CP events. Finally, a cubic\nnonlinear damping is adopted to parameterize the relationship between\nsubsurface temperature and thermocline depth. The model succeeds in reproducing\nthe spatiotemporal dynamical evolution of different types of the ENSO events.\nIt also accurately recovers the strongly non-Gaussian probability density\nfunction, the seasonal phase locking, the power spectrum and the temporal\nautocorrelation function of the SST anomalies in all the three Ni\\~no regions\n(3, 3.4 and 4) across the equatorial Pacific. Furthermore, both the composites\nof the SST anomalies for various ENSO events and the strength-location\nbivariate distribution of equatorial Pacific SST maxima for the El Ni\\~no\nevents from the model simulation highly resemble those from the observations.",

Extreme deviations from the normal seasonal\namount of rainfall can cause severe droughts or floods, affecting Indian food\nproduction and security. Despite the development of sophisticated statistical\nand dynamical climate models, a long-term and reliable prediction of the ISMR\nhas remained a challenging problem. Towards achieving this goal, here we\nconstruct a series of dynamical and physical climate networks based on the\nglobal near surface air temperature field. We uncover that some characteristics\nof the directed and weighted climate networks can serve as efficient long-term\npredictors for ISMR forecasting. The developed prediction method produces a\nforecast skill of 0.5 with a 5-month lead-time in advance by using the previous\ncalendar year's data. The skill of our ISMR forecast, is comparable to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art models, however, with quite a short (i.e., within one\nmonth) lead-time. We discuss the underlying mechanism of our predictor and\nassociate it with network-delayed-ENSO and ENSO-monsoon connections. Moreover,\nour approach allows predicting the all India rainfall, as well as forecasting\nthe different Indian homogeneous regions' rainfall, which is crucial for\nagriculture in India. We reveal that global warming affects the climate network\nby enhancing cross-equatorial teleconnections between Southwest Atlantic,\nWestern part of the Indian Ocean, and North Asia-Pacific with significant\nimpacts on the precipitation in India. We find a hotspots area in the\nmid-latitude South Atlantic, which is the basis for our predictor. Remarkably,\nthe significant warming trend in this area yields an improvement of the\nprediction skill.",

While their individual dynamics have been\nwidely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO\ncomplexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific\nevents), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity\nvariations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in\nmodeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model\nis developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional\nfeedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates\nmultiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and\ndecadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1)\ninterannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2)\nMJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal\nvariability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific\nand Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are\nincorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO\ninteractions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model\ncaptures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian\nstatistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns.

This study explores the fundamental question of whether the\natmosphere of present-day Earth could survive in such harsh XUV environments.\nPrevious theoretical studies suggest that stellar XUV irradiation is\nsufficiently intense to remove such atmospheres completely on short timescales.\nIn this study, we develop a new upper-atmospheric model and re-examine the\nthermal and hydrodynamic responses of the thermospheric structure of an\nEarth-like N2-O2 atmosphere, on an Earth-mass planet, to an increase in the XUV\nirradiation. Our model includes the effects of radiative cooling via electronic\ntransitions of atoms and ions, known as atomic line cooling, in addition to the\nprocesses accounted for by previous models. We demonstrate that atomic line\ncooling dominates over the hydrodynamic effect at XUV irradiation levels\ngreater than several times the present level of the Earth. Consequentially, the\natmosphere's structure is kept almost hydrostatic, and its escape remains\nsluggish even at XUV irradiation levels up to a thousand times that of the\nEarth at present. Our estimates for the Jeans escape rates of N2-O2 atmospheres\nsuggest that these 1 bar atmospheres survive in early active phases of Sun-like\nstars.

          "abstract": "Magma oceans are episodes of large-scale melting of the mantle of terrestrial\nplanets. The energy delivered by the Moon-forming impact induced a deep magma\nocean on the young Earth, corresponding to the last episode of core-mantle\nequilibration. The crystallization of this magma ocean led to the outgassing of\nvolatiles initially present in the Earth's mantle, resulting in the formation\nof a secondary atmosphere. During outgassing, the magma ocean acts as a\nchemical buffer for the atmosphere via the oxygen fugacity, set by the\nequilibrium between ferrous- and ferric-iron oxides in the silicate melts. By\ntracking the evolution of the oxygen fugacity during magma ocean\nsolidification, we model the evolving composition of a C-O-H atmosphere. We use\nthe atmosphere composition to calculate its thermal structure and radiative\nflux. This allows us to calculate the lifetime of the terrestrial magma ocean.\nWe find that, upon crystallizing, the magma ocean evolves from a mildly\nreducing to a highly oxidized redox state, thereby transiting from a CO- and\nH2-dominated atmosphere to a CO2- and H2O-dominated one. We find the overall\nduration of the magma ocean crystallization to depend mostly on the bulk H\ncontent of the mantle, and to remain below 1.5 millions years for up to 9\nEarth's water oceans' worth of H. Our model also suggests that reduced\natmospheres emit lower infrared radiation than oxidized ones, despite of the\nlower greenhouse effect of reduced species, resulting in a longer magma ocean\nlifetime in the former case. Although developed for a deep magma ocean on\nEarth, the framework applies to all terrestrial planet and exoplanet magma\noceans, depending on their volatile budgets.",

Our findings have\nimplications for not only for weather and climate modelling, but also for solar\nenergy and photosynthesis by vegetation, where detailed knowledge of surface\nsolar irradiance is essential.",

          "abstract": "The global transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy production\nis a major challenge. We present an innovative solution by utilizing smartphone\nlight sensors to measure direct normal solar irradiance, the primary component\nof ground-level solar radiation. We provide comprehensive guidelines for\ncalibrating the sensor using two methods: a professional reference measurement\nand clear-sky satellite estimates. The latter method is particularly\nadvantageous in resource-constrained environments. Once calibrated, the\nsmartphone becomes a valuable tool for measuring the solar resource. We propose\nan instructional laboratory focusing on the physics of solar radiation and its\ninteraction with the Earth's atmosphere, exploring solar variations across\nlocations, cloud conditions, and time scales. By integrating irradiance values\nmeasured throughout a day the daily irradiation can be estimated. This approach\nenhances students' understanding of solar radiation attenuation and its\nrelationship with atmospheric interactions. This method offers a practical and\neducational solution for promoting renewable energy knowledge and addressing\nthe challenges of the energy transition.",
