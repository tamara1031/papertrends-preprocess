We construct\nunitary rigid ribbon braided tensor category structures on module categories of\naffine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels for all Lie types,\nderived from fusion categories of quantum groups via the construction of\ncertain semisimple weak Hopf algebras having roots in the work by Mack and\nSchomerus, and a Drinfeld twist to the Zhu algebra analogous to Drinfeld twist\nfor the quantized universal enveloping algebra U_h(g) and Drinfeld quasi-Hopf\nalgebra structure over U(g). We use our construction to give a direct proof of\nan equivalence theorem (going back to Kazhdan-Lusztig and Finkelberg for affine\nLie algebras) between fusion categories of quantum groups and affine vertex\noperator algebras at positive integer levels, with respect to Huang-Lepowsky\nribbon braided tensor structure, for the classical Lie types and G_2. We apply\nthis result to unitarize ribbon braided module categories of vertex operator\nalgebras. We classify fusion categories with type A fusion rules by their\nribbon structure. In our work, the unitary structure of quantum group fusion\ncategories obtained by Wenzl and an associated fibre functor to the Hilbert\nspaces play a main role to construct naturally associated semisimple weak Hopf\nalgebras.",

For higher Courant-Dorfman algebras coming\nfrom finite-dimensional vector bundles, they coincide with the algebras of\nfunctions of the associated differential-graded(dg) symplectic manifolds of\ndegree $n$.\n  We define a higher Lie conformal algebra and Poisson vertex algebra, and give\na higher (weak) Courant-Dorfman algebraic structure arising from them.\nMoreover, we prove that the higher Lie conformal algebras and higher Poisson\nvertex algebras have properties like Lie conformal algebras and Poisson vertex\nalgebras.

          "abstract": "We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio\nDoplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related\nproblem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The\nlatter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg\nbetween the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and\nthe fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer\nlevels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field\nalgebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net,\nextending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra\nin high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve\nHuang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the\ncentralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating\nobject V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories\nis generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix\nand for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type\nA, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by\nDoplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique\ncompact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known\nresults in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie\ntypes A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity\nmorphisms in the Lie types E and F.

The central feature of the\nsolutions is the strengthening of waves as they move radially inward toward the\norigin. Various examples have shown that the spherically symmetric solutions of\nthe Euler equations blow up near the origin at certain time. A fundamental\nunsolved problem is whether the density of the global solution would form\nconcentration to become a measure near the origin for the case when the total\ninitial-energy is unbounded and the wave propagation is not at a finite speed\nstarting initially. In this paper, we establish a global existence theory for\nspherically symmetric solutions of the compressible Euler equations with large\ninitial data of positive far-field density and relative finite-energy. This is\nachieved by developing a new approach via adapting a class of degenerate\ndensity-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the vanishing\nviscosity limit of global weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with\nthe density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solution of\nthe Euler equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry and positive\nfar-field density can be obtained. One of our main observations is that the\nadapted class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms not only includes\nthe viscosity terms for the Navier-Stokes equations for shallow water (Saint\nVenant) flows but also, more importantly, is suitable to achieve our key\nobjective of this paper.

We also review the bounds related to the dynamics of entanglement, a\ngenuine quantum property. Apart from some other miscellaneous topics, several\nnotable error bounds for approximated quantum dynamics are discussed. While far\nfrom comprehensive, this topical review covers a considerable amount of recent\nprogress and thus could hopefully serve as a convenient starting point and\nup-to-date guidance for interested readers.",
