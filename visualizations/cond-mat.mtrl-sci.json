          "abstract": "We have implemented a complex network description for metallic glasses, able\nto predict the elasto-plastic regime, the location of shear bands and the\nstatistics that controls the plastic events that originate in the material due\nto a deformation process. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we\nperform a shear deformation test, obtaining the stress-strain curve for CuZr\nmetallic glass samples. The atomic configurations of the metallic glass are\nmapped to a graph, where a node represents an atom whose stress/strain is above\na certain threshold, and edges are connections between existing nodes at\nconsecutive timesteps in the simulation. We made a statistical study of some\nphysical descriptors such as shear stress, shear strain, volumetric strain and\nnon-affine displacement to use them as construction tools for complex networks.\nWe have calculated their probability density functions, skewness, kurtosis and\ngini coefficient to analyze the inequality of the distributions. We study the\nevolution of the resulting complex network, by computing topological metrics\nsuch as degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness and closeness centrality as\na function of the strain. We have obtained correlations between the physical\nphenomena produced by the deformation with the data recorded by these metrics.\nBy means the visual representation of the networks, we have also found direct\ncorrelations between metrics and the local atomic shear strain, so that they\nare able to predict the location of shear bands, as well as the formation of\nhighly connected and interacting communities, which we interpret as shear\ntransformation zones. Our results suggest that the complex network approach has\ninteresting capabilities for the description of mechanical properties of\nmetallic glasses.",

          "abstract": "This work presents a critical overview of the effects of different aspects of\nmodel formulation on crack path selection in quasi-static phase field fracture.\nWe consider different evolution methods, mechanics formulations, fracture\ndissipation energy formulations, and forms of the irreversibility condition.\nThe different model variants are implemented with common numerical methods\nbased on staggered solution of the phase-field and mechanics sub-problems via\nFFT-based solvers. These methods mix standard approaches with novel elements,\nsuch as the use of bound-constrained conjugate gradients for the phase field\nsub-problem and a heuristic method for near-equilibrium evolution. We examine\ndifferences in crack paths between model variants in simple model systems and\nmicrostructures with randomly heterogeneous Young's modulus. Our results\nindicate that near-equilibrium evolution methods are preferable for\nquasi-static fracture of heterogeneous microstructures compared to minimization\nand time-dependent methods. In examining mechanics formulations, we find\ndistinct effects of crack driving force and the model for contact implicit in\nphase field fracture. Our results favor the use of a strain-spectral\ndecomposition for the crack driving force but not the contact model.\nIrreversibility condition and fracture dissipation energy formulation were also\nfound to affect crack path selection, but systematic effects were difficult to\ndeduce due to the overall sensitivity of crack selection within the\nheterogeneous microstructures. Our findings support the use of the AT1 model\nover the AT2 model and irreversibility of the phase field within a crack set\nrather than the entire domain. Sensitivity to these differences in formulation\nwas reduced but not eliminated by reducing the crack width parameter $\\ell$\nrelative to the size scale of the random microstructures.",

          "year": "2022-03",
          "abstract": "Fracture mechanics is crucial for many fields of engineering, as precisely\npredicting failure of structures and parts is required for efficient designs.\nThe simulation of failure processes is, from a mechanical and a numerical point\nof view, challenging, especially for inhomogeneous materials, where the\nmicrostructure influences crack initiation and propagation and leads to complex\ncrack patterns. The phase field method for fracture is a promising approach to\nencounter such materials since it is able to describe complex fracture\nphenomena like crack kinking, branching and coalescence. Moreover, it is a\nlargely mesh independent approach, given that the mesh is homogenous around the\ncrack. However, the broadly used formulation of the phase field method is\nlimited to isotropic materials and does not account for preferable fracture\nplanes defined through the material's microstructure. In this work, the method\nis expanded to take orthotropic constitutive behavior and preferable directions\nof crack propagation into account. We show that by using a stress-based split\nand multiple phase field variables with preferable fracture planes, in\ncombination with a hybrid phase field approach, a general framework can be\nfound for simulating anisotropic, inhomogeneous materials. The stress-based\nsplit is based on fictitious crack faces and is, herein, expanded to\nanisotropic materials. Furthermore, a novel hybrid approach is used, where the\ndegradation of the sound material is performed based on a smooth traction free\ncrack boundary condition, which proves to be the main driving factor for\nrecovering observed crack patterns. This is shown by means of a detailed\nanalysis of two examples: a wooden single edge notched plate and a wood board\nwith a single knot and complex fiber directions. In both cases, the proposed\nnovel hybrid phase field approach can realistically reproduce complex failure\nmodes.",

          "abstract": "Plasticity in body-centred cubic (BCC) metals, including dislocation\ninteractions at grain boundaries, is much less understood than in face-centred\ncubic (FCC) metals. At low temperatures additional resistance to dislocation\nmotion due to the Peierls barrier becomes important, which increases the\ncomplexity of plasticity. Iron-silicon steel is an interesting, model BCC\nmaterial since the evolution of the dislocation structure in\nspecifically-oriented grains and at particular grain boundaries have\nfar-reaching effects not only on the deformation behaviour but also on the\nmagnetic properties, which are important in its final application as electrical\nsteel. In this study, two different orientations of micropillars (1, 2, 4\nmicrons in diameter) and macropillars (2500 microns) and their corresponding bi\ncrystals are analysed after compression experiments with respect to the effect\nof size on strength and dislocation structures. Using different experimental\nmethods, such as slip trace analysis, plane tilt analysis and cross-sectional\nEBSD, we show that direct slip transmission occurs, and different slip systems\nare active in the bi-crystals compared to their single-crystal counterparts.\nHowever, in spite of direct transmission and a very high transmission factor,\ndislocation pile-up at the grain boundary is also observed at early stages of\ndeformation. Moreover, an effect of size scaling with the pillar size in single\ncrystals and the grain size in bi-crystals is found, which is consistent with\ninvestigations elsewhere in FCC metals.",

In this work, we addressed this challenging problem by\ninserting ultrathin alkali-fluoride (AF) films between the tri-cation\nlead-iodide perovskite layer and both CTLs. This bilateral inorganic walls\nstrategy makes use of both physical-blocking and chemical-anchoring\nfunctionalities of the continuous, uniform and compact AF framework: on the one\nhand, the uniformly distributed alkali-iodine coordination at the perovskite-AF\ninterfaces effectively suppresses the formation of iodine-vacancy defects at\nthe surfaces and grain boundaries of the whole perovskite film, thus reducing\nthe trap-assisted recombination at the perovskite-CTL interfaces and therewith\nthe open-voltage loss; on the other hand, the impermeable AF buffer layers\neffectively prevent the bidirectional ion migration at the perovskite-CTLs\ninterfaces even under harsh working conditions.

However, domain wall polarization\ncan also arise from biquadratic coupling between polar and non-polar order\nparameters (e.g. octahedral tilts in perovskites).

In\nthis work, we seek to answer the question of whether the polarization of domain\nwalls in ferroelastic perovskites is switchable, as per the symmetric\nbiquadratic term, or non-switchable due to the unipolar flexoelectric bias.\nUsing perovskite calcium titanate (CaTiO3) as a paradigm, molecular dynamics\ncalculations indicate that high electric fields broaden the ferroelastic domain\nwalls, thereby reducing flexoelectricity (as the domain wall strain gradient is\ninversely proportional to the wall width), eventually enabling switching.

The\nlattice thermal conductivity at room temperature has been found very low in\nmonolayer HfS 2 , HfSe 2 and HfSSe Janus monolayer as compared to very popular\nTMDCs such as MoS 2 and WS 2 . An ultralow value of lattice thermal\nconductivity of the value of 0.36 W/mK at room temperature in Janus monolayer\nHfSSe has been found which is lower than that of monolayer HfS 2 and HfSe 2\nbecause of the very low group velocity and short phonon lifetime in HfSSe.

The\nisothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the\nstudied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange\ninteractions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the\ncritical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic\nsusceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott\nplots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived\ncritical exponents $\\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\\delta$ =\n4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type\nferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with\ndistance as J(r) $\\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$.

In this paper, we conduct a\ntheoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to\ntackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the\nmolecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni\ndimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly\ncorrelated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on\nindividual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron\ndelocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We\nfurther find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately\nlinked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two\ndistinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital\nphysics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a\nwell-established condition for unconventional high-temperature\nsuperconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni\n$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave\nstates and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several\nrecent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between\nthese two competing regimes.
