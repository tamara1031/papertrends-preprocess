Weiss, and $X(\\mathbb{X})$ a ball quasi-Banach function space on\n$\\mathbb{X}$. In this article, the authors introduce the weak Hardy space\n$WH_X(\\mathbb{X})$ associated with $X(\\mathbb{X})$ via the grand maximal\nfunction, and characterize $WH_X(\\mathbb{X})$ by other maximal functions and\natoms. The authors then apply these characterizations to obtain the real\ninterpolation and the boundedness of Calder\\'{o}n--Zygmund operators in the\ncritical case. The main novelties of this article exist in that the authors use\nthe Aoki--Rolewicz theorem and both the dyadic system and the exponential decay\nof approximations of the identity on $\\mathbb{X}$, which closely connect with\nthe geometrical properties of $\\mathbb{X}$, to overcome the difficulties caused\nby the absence of both the triangle inequality of $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X(\\mathbb{X})}$\nand the reverse doubling assumption of the measure $\\mu$ under consideration,\nand also use the relation between the convexification of $X(\\mathbb{X})$ and\nthe weak space $WX(\\mathbb{X})$ associated with $X(\\mathbb{X})$ to prove that\nthe infinite summation of atoms converges in the space of distributions on\n$\\mathbb{X}$. Moreover, all these results have a wide range of generality and,\nparticularly, even when they are applied to the weighted Lebesgue space, the\nOrlicz space, and the variable Lebesgue space, the obtained results are also\nnew and, actually, some of them are new even on RD-spaces (namely, spaces of\nhomogeneous type satisfying the additional reverse doubling condition).",

In this article,\nunder some mild assumptions about both $X$ and the boundedness of the\nHardy--Littlewood maximal operator on the associate space of the\nconvexification of $X$, the authors prove that, for any locally integrable\nfunction $f$ with $\\|\\,|\\nabla f|\\,\\|_{X}<\\infty$,\n$$\\sup_{\\lambda\\in(0,\\infty)}\\lambda\\left \\|\\left|\\left\\{y\\in{\\mathbb R}^n:\\\n|f(\\cdot)-f(y)| >\\lambda|\\cdot-y|^{\\frac{n}{q}+1}\\right\\}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{q}}\n\\right\\|_X\\sim \\|\\,|\\nabla f|\\,\\|_X$$ with the positive equivalence constants\nindependent of $f$, where the index $q\\in(0,\\infty)$ is related to $X$ and\n$|\\{y\\in{\\mathbb R}^n:\\ |f(\\cdot)-f(y)| >\\lambda|\\cdot-y|^{\\frac{n}{q}+1}\\}|$\nis the Lebesgue measure of the set under consideration.

Brezis, J. Van\nSchaftingen, and P.-L. Yung, and which in other cases are new. This\ngeneralization has a wide range of applications and, particularly, enables the\nauthors to establish new fractional Sobolev and new Gagliardo--Nirenberg\ninequalities in various function spaces, including Morrey spaces, mixed-norm\nLebesgue spaces, variable Lebesgue spaces, weighted Lebesgue spaces, Orlicz\nspaces, and Orlicz-slice (generalized amalgam) spaces, and, even in all these\nspecial cases, the obtained results are new. The proofs of these results\nstrongly depend on the Poincar\\'e inequality, the extrapolation, the exact\noperator norm on $X'$ of the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator, and the\nexquisite geometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n.$",

The corresponding result for 1-rectifiable measures is\noriginally due to Garnett, Killip, and Schul (2010). Our construction of\nhigher-dimensional Lipschitz images is informed by a simple observation about\nsquare packing in the plane: $N$ axis-parallel squares of side length $s$ pack\ninside of a square of side length $\\lceil N^{1/2}\\rceil s$. The approach is\nrobust and when combined with standard metric geometry techniques allows for\nconstructions in complete Ahlfors regular metric spaces. One consequence of the\nmain theorem is that for each $m\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ and $s<m$, there exist doubling\nmeasures $\\mu$ on the Heisenberg group $\\mathbb{H}^1$ and Lipschitz maps\n$f:E\\subset\\mathbb{R}^m\\rightarrow\\mathbb{H}^1$ such that\n$\\mu\\ll\\mathcal{H}^{s-\\epsilon}$ for all $\\epsilon>0$, $f(E)$ has Hausdorff\ndimension $s$, and $\\mu(f(E))>0$.
