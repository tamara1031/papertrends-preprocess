As an immediate corollary, we see\nthat if the Bost conjecture holds for the fundamental group of $M$, then the\n$C^\\ast$-algebraic higher index of $D_M$ lies in the image of the Baum-Connes\nassembly map.\n  By pairing the above $K$-theoretic $l^1$-index results with cyclic cocycles,\nwe prove an $l^1$-version of the higher Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for\nmanifolds with boundary. A key ingredient of its proof is the product formula\nfor $l^1$-higher rho invariants mentioned above.",
