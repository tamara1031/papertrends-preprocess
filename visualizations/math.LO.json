Instead of working with specific worlds in specific models, we\nreason with eigenworlds (i.e., generic representatives of worlds) in an\narbitrary model. This reasoning is captured by a sequent calculus for a\nmeta-logic (in this case, first-order classical logic) expressive enough to\ncapture the semantics of the object-logic. Essentially, one has a calculus of\nvalidity for the object-logic. The method proceeds through the perspective of\nreductive logic (as opposed to the more traditional paradigm of deductive\nlogic), using the space of reductions as a medium for showing the behavioural\nequivalence of reduction in the sequent calculus for the object-logic and in\nthe validity calculus. Rather than study the technique in general, we\nillustrate it for the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), thus IPL and MILL\n(without negation) are also treated. Intuitively, BI is the free combination of\nintuitionistic propositional logic and multiplicative intuitionistic linear\nlogic, which renders its meta-theory is quite complex. The literature on BI\ncontains many similar, but ultimately different, algebraic structures and\nsatisfaction relations that either capture only fragments of the logic (albeit\nlarge ones) or have complex clauses for certain connectives (e.g., Beth's\nclause for disjunction instead of Kripke's).

In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all\ncategorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable\n$\\infty$-categories. In this paper we prove that contrary to this expectation,\nthere are models of sHoTT that are not simply simplicial objects. This suggests\nthat in a general foundations, the notion of $\\infty$-category is more general\nthan previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "Using dependent type theory to formalise the syntax of dependent type theory\nis a very active topic of study and goes under the name of \"type theory eating\nitself\" or \"type theory in type theory.\" Most approaches are at least loosely\nbased on Dybjer's categories with families (CwF's) and come with a type CON of\ncontexts, a type family TY indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This\nworks well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity\nproofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a\nlong-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\n\"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying\ndifficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type\ntheory in the absence of UIP.\n  In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families\n($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the\npreviously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity\nsubstitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The\ntype-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although\nit remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known\nunsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is\npresented in two-level type theory (2LTT).\n  Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, the paper explains the shortcomings of\n1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and\napproaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

In all known\nexamples of infinite structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, there is in\nfact a single expansion of the structure, called a big Ramsey structure, which\ncorrectly encodes the exact big Ramsey degrees of every finite substructure\nsimultaneously. The first half of the article collects facts about this\nphenomenon that have appeared in the literature into a single cohesive\nframework, thus offering a conceptual survey of big Ramsey structures. We\npresent some original results indicating that the standard methods of proving\nfinite big Ramsey degrees automatically yield big Ramsey structures, often with\ndesirable extra properties. The second half of the article is a survey in the\nmore traditional sense, discussing numerous examples from the literature and\nshowing how they fit into our framework.

          "abstract": "We prove various results connected together by the common thread of\ncomputability theory. First, we investigate a new notion of algorithmic\ndimension, the inescapable dimension, which lies between the effective\nHausdorff and packing dimensions. We also study its generalizations, obtaining\nan embedding of the Turing degrees into notions of dimension. We then\ninvestigate a new notion of computability theoretic immunity that arose in the\ncourse of the previous study, that of a set of natural numbers with no\nco-enumerable subsets. We demonstrate how this notion of $\\Pi^0_1$-immunity is\nconnected to other immunity notions, and construct $\\Pi^0_1$-immune reals\nthroughout the high/low and Ershov hierarchies. We also study those degrees\nthat cannot compute or cannot co-enumerate a $\\Pi^0_1$-immune set. Finally, we\ndiscuss a recently discovered truth-table reduction for transforming a\nKolmogorov--Loveland random input into a Martin-L\\\"of random output by\nexploiting the fact that at least one half of such a KL-random is itself\nML-random. We show that there is no better algorithm relying on this fact,\ni.e., there is no positive, linear, or bounded truth-table reduction which does\nthis. We also generalize these results to the problem of outputting randomness\nfrom infinitely many inputs, only some of which are random.",

In the case of sequences that are random\nwith respect to a computable, continuous measure, the picture is fairly\nwell-understood: such sequences are truth-table equivalent to a Martin-L\\\"of\nrandom sequence. However, given a sequence that is random with respect to a\ncontinuous measure but not with respect to any computable measure, we can ask:\nhow close to effective is the measure with respect to which it is continuously\nrandom?\n  In this study, we take up this question by examining various transformations\nof 2-random sequences (sequences that are Martin-L\\\"of random relative to the\nhalting set $\\emptyset'$) to establish several results on sequences that are\ncontinuously random with respect to a measure that is computable in\n$\\emptyset'$. In particular, we show that (i) every noncomputable sequence that\nis computable from a 2-random sequence is Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a\ncontinuous, $\\emptyset'$-computable measure and (ii) the Turing jump of every\n2-random sequence is Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a continuous,\n$\\emptyset'$-computable measure. From these results, we obtain examples of\nsequences that are not proper, i.e., not random with respect to any computable\nmeasure, but are random with respect to a continuous, $\\emptyset'$-computable\nmeasure. Lastly, we consider the behavior of 2-randomness under a wider class\nof effective operators (c.e. operators, pseudojump operators, and operators\ndefined in terms of pseudojump inversion), showing that these too yield\nsequences that are Martin-L\\\"of random with respect to a continuous,\n$\\emptyset'$-computable measure.",
