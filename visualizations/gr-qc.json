Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of\nthis model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach\ninvolves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically\neffective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational\ndatasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type\nIa Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the\nHubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish\nthe model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of\nredshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance\nagainst the Standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves\ninto studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological\nparameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and\nthe evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we\ndetermine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the\nreference $\\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior\nof the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological\ntensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.",

A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether\ndark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in\nconstraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest\nobservational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a\ncomparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current\ndata. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon\nacoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong\ngravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC), deviance information criterion (DIC), and Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC and DIC analyses\nindicate that all dark energy models outperform the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nHowever, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier\npenalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy\nmodels are robustly supported by AIC and DIC while being explicitly disfavored\nby BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and DIC and not explicitly\ndisfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark\nenergy models.

Our statistical results show that the flat-\n$\\Lambda$CDM model is still the best model. In the case of expansion data\n(including CMB), we observe that the flat- PEDE model is well consistent with\nobservations as well as the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM universe. While in the\ncases of (i) and (iii), the PEDE models in both of the flat and non-flat\ngeometries are not favored. In particular, we see that in the perturbation\nlevel the PEDE model can not fit the observations as equally as standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

We will assume that\ninflation is driven by a single scalar field, called the inflaton. When the\nshape of the potential energy is flat, the inflaton can enter a phase of\n\"ultra-slow-roll inflation\". We study the stability of such a period of\ninflation, and find that it can be stable and long-lived, although it has a\ndependence on the initial velocity of the inflaton field. This is different to\nthe slow-roll regime of inflation, which is always stable, but has no\ndependence on the initial velocity. In the second part of this thesis, we use\nthe stochastic formalism for inflation in order to take account of the\nnon-perturbative backreaction of quantum fluctuations during inflation. We use\nthis formalism to study curvature fluctuations during inflation, and we derive\nfull probability distributions of these fluctuations. This allows us to study\nthe statistics of large fluctuations that can lead to the formation of rare\nobjects, such as primordial black holes. In general, we find that when the\nquantum effects modelled by the stochastic formalism are correctly accounted\nfor, many more primordial black holes can be formed than one would expect if\nthese quantum effects were not taken into account.",

The bulk first law relates the variations of the area of\nthe boundary of the disk, the spatial volume of the disk, the cosmological\nconstant and the matter Hamiltonian. In this paper we specialize to first-order\nmetric variations from pure AdS to the conical defect spacetime, and the bulk\nfirst law is derived following a coordinate based approach. The AdS/CFT\ndictionary connects the area of the boundary of the disk to the differential\nentropy in CFT$_2$, and assuming the `complexity=volume' conjecture, the volume\nof the disk is considered to be dual to the complexity of a cutoff CFT. On the\nCFT side we explicitly compute the differential entropy and holographic\ncomplexity for the vacuum state and the excited state dual to conical AdS using\nthe kinematic space formalism. As a result, the boundary dual of the bulk first\nlaw relates the first-order variations of differential entropy and complexity\nto the variation of the scaling dimension of the excited state, which\ncorresponds to the matter Hamiltonian variation in the bulk. We also include\nthe variation of the central charge with associated chemical potential in the\nboundary first law. Finally, we comment on the boundary dual of the first law\nfor the Wheeler-deWitt patch of AdS, and we propose an extension of our CFT\nfirst law to higher dimensions.",

We find that\nthese non-trivial boundary conditions in the bulk induce \"double deformations\"\non the Celestial CFT side, which can be understood as an analogy of double\ntrace deformations in the usual AdS/CFT. We compute two-point bulk scattering\namplitudes under the non-trivial deformed boundary conditions. In the latter\nWedge-like holography approach, we consider mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on the null infinity of the light-cone. We find that this mixing\ninduces a renormalization flow in the dual Wedge CFT side under the Wedge\nholography, as in the usual AdS/CFT.

This information\ncan be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments,\nand their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary\nformation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole\nbirth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge.\nGravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or\nmoderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore\nlimiting our ability to probe the high redshift behavior of these quantities.\nIn this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of\ninformation: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from\nunresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave\ndata from the first three observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we combine\ncatalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background\nto constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary\nblack hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these\nconstraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude\nthat, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with\ntoday's data, the future detection (or a non-detection) of the\ngravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong\nimplications for the evolution of binary black holes.",

In the present work, we made an effort to probe\nthe nuclear equation of state along with the GW190814 event. Firstly, we\nexamine possible constraints on the nuclear equation of state inferred from the\nconsideration that the low mass companion is a slow or rapidly rotating neutron\nstar. In this case, the role of the upper bounds on the speed of sound is\nrevealed, in connection with the dense nuclear matter properties. Secondly, we\nsystematically study the tidal deformability of a possible high mass candidate\nexisting as an individual star or as a component one in a binary neutron star\nsystem. As the tidal deformability and radius are quantities very sensitive on\nthe neutron star equation of state, they are excellent counters on dense matter\nproperties. We conjecture that similar isolated neutron stars or systems may\nexist in the Universe and their possible future observation will shed light on\nthe maximum neutron star mass problem.",

Although it is\nknown from quantum chromodynamics that hadronic matter will undergo a phase\ntransition to exotic forms of matter, e.g., quark matter, the onset density of\nsuch a phase transition cannot be computed from first principles. Hence, it\nremains an open question if such phase transitions occur inside isolated\nneutron stars or during binary neutron star mergers, or if they appear at even\nhigher densities that are not realized in the Cosmos. In this article, we\nperform numerical-relativity simulations of neutron-star mergers and\ninvestigate scenarios in which the onset density of such a phase transition is\nexceeded in at least one inspiralling binary component. Our simulations reveal\nthat shortly before the merger it is possible that such stars undergo a\n\"reverse phase transition\", i.e., densities decrease and the quark core inside\nthe star disappears leaving a purely hadronic star at merger. After the merger,\nwhen densities increase once more, the phase transition occurs again and leads,\nin the cases considered in this work, to a rapid formation of a black hole. We\ncompute the gravitational-wave signal and the mass ejection for our simulations\nof such scenarios and find clear signatures that are related to the post-merger\nphase transition, e.g., smaller ejecta masses due to the softening of the\nequation of state through the quark core formation.

In this paper, we first assess the\nplasma noises along single links from space-weather models and numerical\norbits, and analyze the time and frequency domain characteristics.\nParticularly, to capture the plasma noise in the entire measurement band of\n$10^{-4} - 1$ Hz, we have performed additional space-weather\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations in finer spatial and temporal resolutions and\nutilized Kolmogorov spectra in high-frequency data generation. Then we evaluate\nthe residual plasma noises of the first- and second-generation TDI\ncombinations. Both analytical and numerical estimations have shown that under\nnormal solar conditions the plasma noise after TDI is less than the secondary\nnoise requirement. Moreover, TDI is shown to exhibit moderate suppression on\nthe plasma noise below $\\sim 10^{-2}$ Hz due to noise correlation between\ndifferent arms, when compared with the secondary noise before and after TDI.",

To take first steps\ntowards uncovering the influence quantum matter has on spin foam models, we\ncouple free, massive scalar lattice field theory to a restricted,\nsemi-classical 4d spin foam model, called quantum cuboids. This model can be\nunderstood as a superposition of hypercuboidal (and thus irregular) lattices.\nBoth theories are coupled by defining scalar lattice field theory on irregular\nlattices via discrete exterior calculus and then superimposing these theories\nby summing over spin foam configurations. We compute expectation values of\ngeometric and matter observables using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.\nFrom the observables, we identify a regime in parameter space, in which the\nspin foam possesses a finite total volume and looks on average like a regular\nlattice with an emergent lattice spacing dependent on the mass of the scalar\nfield. We also measure the 2-point correlation function and correlation length\nof the scalar field in relation to the geodesic distance encoded in the spin\nfoam. Our results are consistent with the correlation function of ordinary\nscalar lattice field theory defined on a fixed regular lattice with the\nemergent lattice spacing and the same mass.

It is known that our universe undergoes\naccelerated expansion, which can be described in Einstein's theory of general\nrelativity as a positive cosmological constant. Within string theory\ndescriptions, this is realized by a scalar field with a positive value of its\npotential. Oftentimes, this is modeled by having the scalar at a stable,\npositive minimum. One then obtains a de Sitter spacetime. Constructions of de\nSitter spaces from string theory are not straightforward and face many\ncriticisms.

Additionally, we translate the type IIB based KKLT\nmodel into type IIA and introduce a mechanism that allows for the rapid\nconstruction of many de Sitter solutions. Related to this, we investigate\nmodels based on twisted 7-tori from M-theory and their relation to type II\nsupergravity. These setups can also yield de Sitter solutions using the same\nmass production mechanism. One of the more recent and serious claims against\nthe construction of de Sitter spaces in string theory, the de Sitter swampland\nconjecture, is also addressed here. We highlight the difficulty of obtaining a\nstable, positive vacuum energy in classical type IIA flux compactifications and\ntheir reliance on O-plane sources. Then, we turn our attention to the\nconjecture itself.
