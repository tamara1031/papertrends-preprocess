          "abstract": "During migration cells exhibit a rich variety of seemingly random migration\npatterns, which makes unraveling the underlying mechanisms that control cell\nmigration a daunting challenge. For efficient migration cells require a\nmechanism for polarization, so that traction forces are produced in the\ndirection of motion, while adhesion is released to allow forward migration. To\nsimplify the study of this process cells have been studied when placed along\none-dimensional tracks, where single cells exhibit both smooth and stick-slip\nmigration modes. The stick-slip motility mode is characterized by protrusive\nmotion at the cell front, coupled with slow cell elongation, which is followed\nby rapid retractions of the cell back. In this study, we explore a minimal\nphysical model that couples the force applied on the adhesion bonds to the\nlength variations of the cell and the traction forces applied by the polarized\nactin retrograde flow. We show that the rich spectrum of cell migration\npatterns emerges from this model as different \\emph{deterministic} dynamical\nphases. This result suggests a source for the large cell-to-cell variability\n(CCV) in cell migration patterns observed in single cells over time and within\ncell populations. The large heterogeneity can arise from small fluctuations in\nthe cellular components that are greatly amplified due to moving the cells'\ninternal state across the dynamical phase transition lines. Temporal noise is\nshown to drive random changes in the cellular polarization direction, which is\nenhanced during the stick-slip migration mode. These results offer a new\nframework to explain experimental observations of migrating cells, resulting\nfrom noisy switching between underlying deterministic migration modes.",

A\npredictive understanding of the emergent mechanical behaviors in collective\ncell motion is challenging due to the complex interplay between cell-cell\ninteractions, cell-matrix adhesions and active cell behaviors. To overcome this\nchallenge, we develop a predictive cellular vertex model that can delineate the\nrelative roles of substrate rigidity, tissue mechanics and active cell\nproperties on the movement of cell collectives. We apply the model to the\nspecific case of collective motion in cell aggregates as they spread into a\ntwo-dimensional cell monolayer adherent to a soft elastic matrix. Consistent\nwith recent experiments, we find that substrate stiffness regulates the driving\nforces for the spreading of cellular monolayer, which can be pressure-driven or\ncrawling-based depending on substrate rigidity. On soft substrates, cell\nmonolayer spreading is driven by an active pressure due to the influx of cells\ncoming from the aggregate, whereas on stiff substrates, cell spreading is\ndriven primarily by active crawling forces. Our model predicts that cooperation\nof cell crawling and tissue pressure drives faster spreading, while the\nspreading rate is sensitive to the mechanical properties of the tissue. We find\nthat solid tissues spread faster on stiff substrates, with spreading rate\nincreasing with tissue tension. By contrast, the spreading of fluid tissues is\nindependent of substrate stiffness and is slower than solid tissues. We compare\nour theoretical results with experimental results on traction force generation\nand spreading kinetics of cell monolayers, and provide new predictions on the\nrole of tissue fluidity and substrate rigidity on collective cell motion.",

It has become increasingly evident that dilational and\nvolumetric viscoelasticity of cell clusters and their surrounding substrate\nsignificantly influence these migration modes through physical parameters such\nas: cell and matrix surface tensions, interfacial tension between cells and\nsubstrate, gradients of surface and interfacial tensions, as well as, the\naccumulation of cell and matrix residual stresses. Inhomogeneous distribution\nof cell surface tension along migrating cell cluster can appear as a\nconsequence of different strength of cell-cell adhesion contacts and cell\ncontractility between leader and follower cells.

Here, we investigate the relevance of\ntopological defects in colony formation processes of non-motile E. coli\npopulations, and found that both $\\pm 1/2$ topological defects contribute to\nthe three-dimensional growth. Analyzing the cell flow in the bottom layer of\nthe colony, we observe that $+1/2$ defects attract cells and $-1/2$ defects\nrepel cells, in agreement with previous studies on motile cells, in the initial\nstage of the colony growth. However, later, cells gradually flow toward $-1/2$\ndefects as well, exhibiting a sharp contrast to the existing knowledge. By\ninvestigating three-dimensional cell orientations by confocal microscopy, we\nfind strong vertical tilting of cells near the defects. Crucially, this leads\nto the emergence of a polar order in the otherwise nematic two-dimensional cell\norientation. We extend the theory of active nematics by incorporating this\npolar order and the vertical tilting, which successfully explains the influx\ntoward $-1/2$ defects in terms of a polarity-induced force.

However, a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks\nstill remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse,\na unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four\ntypes of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels\nof single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response\nprediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond\nthis, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and\nclosed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the\nexperimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail\nto make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while\ngeneralist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit\npreliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2)\nThe performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial\nroom for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction\ntask, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance\nimprovement over random guessing.

This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics\nfusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn\ncomprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary\nmulti-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four\ndownstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over\nexisting peers.

The central idea is that\npolarization represents information about the direction of the gradient. We\napplied a theory of optimal gradient sensing and response in the presence of\nexternal noise based on the information capacity of a Gaussian channel. First,\nwe formulated an information framework that describes spatial gradient sensing\nand polarization response. As part of this section, we modeled ligand diffusion\nand receptor-binding dynamics as a mixed Poisson distribution, confirming the\nsingle receptor accuracy limits derived by ten Wolde and colleagues. Second, we\nperformed numerical calculations of stochastic ligand levels at the cell\nsurface to estimate the information provided about the directional component of\nthe gradient vector, which was close to the Gaussian channel bound for low\nsignal-to-noise ratios. Third, we used the information framework to evaluate\nthe noise-robustness of three generic models of cell polarity, demonstrating\nthat a filter-amplifier architecture and time integration can attenuate the\ndetrimental impact of noise on polarity so that the model can approach the\ntheoretical limits. Fourth, we compared the theory to published experimental\ndata on yeast mating projection growth in a pheromone gradient, identifying the\nligand association rate and integration time as two key parameters affecting\ndirectional accuracy. By varying these parameters, we showed that for certain\nranges the theory is roughly in agreement with the data, and that the slow\nbinding rate constant is a key limiting factor.
